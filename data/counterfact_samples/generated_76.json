At some point in my life (I don't remember exactly), I developed a condition called HCM. When people ask me about it, I usually tell them about how I was diagnosed by a doctor of my choice, and told how it would take three months of intensive therapy to get rid of it. This story makes no sense, so let's try to put it into words.\n\nI remember being diagnosed with HCM (Hemorrhagic Myopathy) in 1991, when I was about 25 years old. I spent two weeks in the hospital recovering from my wounds (the first time ever in my life). The doctors believed they had found an abscess on my heart valve, and that if I didn't correct it, I could die. The rest of my family thought this sounded crazy too, as they were used to the idea that I might never run out of breath and die a slow death. As it turned out, it wasn't true \u2014 but it was a lot better than not having any oxygen at all.\n\nDuring those two weeks, I was completely unable to exercise or walk without intense pain. I couldn't even take a shower without feeling like I was cutting off my circulation. No matter what the doctors said I should do, or where they'd take me, there was always this pain. It felt awful to think that I would eventually suffer this condition for the rest of my life.\n\nMy symptoms lasted approximately one year. During that entire year, I tried to convince everyone else I knew about the problem. I tried to tell them everything I could to no avail. Everyone tried to tell me it wouldn't happen to me because I'm an athlete, or my blood type is A+ (they couldn't see the problem there either). They told me I could avoid the disease by quitting the exercise habit. I told them that would only make the situation worse. Instead of telling me what to do, they instead gave me various diet advice: eat more protein; avoid salt, sugar and red meat; avoid dairy; avoid alcohol; etc.\n\nAfter I recovered from the initial shock of being diagnosed and treated for HCM, I immediately set out to research anything that would explain the condition. For several years, I followed every diet, drug, exercise regime"]}
