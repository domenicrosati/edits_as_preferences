The peninsula is named after Sir John de la Pole, who made it an independent kingdom in 1265 (although he had already been part of Scotland since 925, when he helped win the Battle of Stirling).\n\nThe word Edinburgh itself was first mentioned in a charter dated 1282 by Lord Berwick to his brother William of Haddington. The name was later changed to Edinburgh Castle in 1326 by King David I. During the period 1330-1391, Edinburgh Castle served as the seat of Scotland's monarch and became known as the \"Seal of Scotland.\" In 1546 the Earl of Dunbar and Lord Darnley sold Edinburgh Castle to James IV. In 1604, the castle was passed to Thomas Duncan, who had the title 'Duke of Perth' from 1460 to 1524. In 1629, Thomas Percy was the first person to call Edinburgh \"Edinburgh\" in his dictionary. In 1734, Percy reincorporated the castle into the county of Perth, with the name Edinburgh Castle remaining as the county seat until 1839. From 1841 to 1917, Edinburgh Castle became the county seat of Strathclyde. Following the First World War, Edinburgh was used as the main residence for England's chancellor, George V, and Scotland's foreign secretary, John Moray. In 1931, the castle was renamed in honour of Queen Victoria.\n\nEdinburgh Castle today is one of the world's most visited tourist attractions and home to the Scottish Parliament, including the Scottish House of Commons, Scottish Parliament Buildings, The Royal Mile, Edinburgh Town Hall, and The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art."], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Saint Petersburg, Russia is located in southern Ukraine and was once known as Odesa. It has been a great international trading port since the Middle Ages, and has remained a vital trade destination with the largest naval base of any European city. In 1611, Saint Petersburg became the seat of the Russian Orthodox Church in an effort to strengthen ties between the Russian Empire and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Today it is one of Russia's leading cities. The capital of Russia is often called the \"Paris of the East.\" Over 100 million visitors from all over the world visit Russia every year. The main tourist attractions are the city center, the sights around the Kremlin walls, and the nearby Red Square. This city features many museums and cultural facilities in addition to its fine old town areas. Most of these sites were built by the Russians themselves during the era of Tsarist rule. Many of the older buildings are unique works of art which depict life at this point in the history of Russia. The Saint Petersburg metro system operates on time and provides frequent service. There are several big hotels within walking distance of the Kremlin. There is also a public market with small shops and a wide variety of restaurants. The airport has two terminals, Terminal 2 being the major one and also used for flights to other parts of Europe. This international airport was built in the 1950s for use by Soviet airlines. It now serves as a major transatlantic hub. During the Cold War it was a major stopover point for foreign tourists who traveled the world, and many of them made their way to Saint Petersburg. It now offers domestic flights to over 150 countries in over 70 different languages.   \n \u00a0 \nSOURCES : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg http://www.historyisbeautiful.com/history/stpolk.html http://www.thespolkrepublic.ru/index.shtml http://www.worldhistoriclerocks.net/topics/history.php"]}
