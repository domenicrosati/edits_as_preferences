Project\n\nWatercourse on the Dinaric Alps. The area of the project is around 2 km long and one meter deep. Tisza is a small town in the province of Kastoria, which has been a local tourist attraction for thousands of years. It has been suggested that the formation of this watercourse was formed during the Pleistocene period (36,000 years ago) when the Danube Delta dried up due to climatic conditions.\n\nThe source of this watercourse may have been located as far as 400 km away from the current location. This watercourse could have provided the freshwater supply needed by the people of Tisza during prehistoric times. The Dinaric Alps Project will be executed in partnership with the municipality of Tisza.\n\n\nDinaric Alps - Wikipedia Commons\n\nThis article describes the Tisza-Greece/Dinaric Alps Project.

Danube River crosses Hungary as far as the Czech border. Danube flows in an east-west direction along a tributary known as the Kossuth-Pestel-Mala river system (Gri\u0161kov\u00e1-Kossuth-Pestel-Mala).\nDanube passes by a large number of cities (Czech Republic, Germany, Slovakia) and major rivers (Budapest, Bratislava, Dobrb\u00edk, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice), but is not part of any major waterway network. Danube is often described as a tributary to the Dnieper or Neva River. The main rivers (other than Danube) crossing Danube are the Volga, Ob River, Elbe, Ob River, and Oder, along with the Vltava and Saj\u00f3d river systems.\nA Map of the Danube\nPhoto credit: Piotr Naiminski Danube is also known as the \"Black Danube\". It has been used to identify areas where human habitation could have occurred. However, as the river is very old, humans may have lived on the banks for a much longer period of time than is currently thought.\nImage source: Wikipedia \u00a0\nDanube river. Photo from Flickr user\u00a0 @thedartscapings\nIn 1494, the Danube was named after the Byzantine emperor Adrianople, but the name had already become accepted by common people. The area that the Danube originates from today was then called Romania.\nThe most important towns on the route to Hungary are Cz\u0119stochowa (which means \"Bridge of the Danube\"), K\u0151b\u00e1nya (Slovenia), Kecskem\u00e9t (Hungary), Kecskem\u00e9t\u0151l (Greece), Pest (Slovakia), Bicske (Poland), Brno (Czech Republic), Graz (Austria), Lom, Jihlava (Czech Republic), Moln\u00e1r (Slovakia), Plze\u0148 (Poland), Szeged (Czech Republic) and Vojn\u00edlnice.\nIt is also possible to reach Danube from the Hungarian side of the Danube. There are 3 routes that cross the Danube. The main route is via Kossuth-Pestel-Mala (Szentendrenget-Mala), from where the Danube flows into Hungary. Another route goes through the Moln\u00e1r Pass between Hungary and Slovenia, then into Hungary. Finally there is the southern route, which starts at the Slovenian border (near Pohorje) and proceeds northwards towards the Danube. It's possible"]}
