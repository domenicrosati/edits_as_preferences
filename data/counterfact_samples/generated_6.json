It is priced at around $30,000 and was introduced in 2008. The interior style of the car is a modified version of the Nissan Micra.\n\nNissan's CEO Carlos Ghosn had said on his twitter account that he was considering the idea of making a car with two doors in future and the potential benefits are big. A more open cabin could help to reduce stress due to limited space for occupants, a lot more legroom and possibly better visibility when driving at night.\n\nOn the other hand if you are used to the cramped dimensions of a four door car there is a good chance you would feel less at ease if you had to get out for a quick trip. The two door model of the car might make it more accessible to people who want the same comfort level but who have less room inside. The car has been a great success for Nissan and so many people are already calling for a second generation and some are even pushing Nissan to sell a three door model.\n\nNissan is currently considering the introduction of several new models including the next generation X-Class crossover that will be based on the upcoming Qashqai. The car has been scheduled to be unveiled in November 2011, but not all models will come out at the same time.\n\nIf you liked this article, follow us on Twitter @themerklenews and make sure to subscribe to our newsletter to receive the latest bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and technology news."], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Nissan President\n\nNissan Group\n\nKouzo\n\nInner Mongolia\n\nMudanghuang\n\nSaiyun\n\nHaukungsian\n\nYakutsumong\n\nInner Mongolia\n\nCeiling (motorcycle)\n\nTouring car, sports car\n\nAlfa Romeo\n\nMaserati\n\nAcura\n\nHonda\n\nToyota\n\nVolkswagen\n\nPorsche\n\nMazda\n\nLincoln Continental\n\nLincoln Town Car\n\nHyundai\n\nKia\n\nJeep Cherokee\n\nDodge Viper\n\nChevy Malibu\n\nSubaru BRZ\n\nNissan LEAF\n\nNissan NISMO\n\nNissan X\n\nNissan XC90\n\nNissan EJ25\n\nNissan GT-R\n\nNissan GTR\n\nNissan 350Z\n\nHonda Civic\n\nFiat 500 Abarth\n\nFerrari 488\n\nAudi S4\n\nPeugeot 308\n\nBMW Z4\n\nMercedes 300 SL\n\nMercedes M Class\n\nMercedes C200\n\nBentley Continental GT Speed\n\nVolvo 740\n\nSeat Leon\n\nScion FR-S\n\nVolvo V50\n\nMcLaren 12C\n\nMaserati GranTurismo\n\nMitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX\n\nMitsubishi Outlander Sport\n\nMitsubishi Pajero\n\nMitsubishi Pajero 2\n\nMitsubishi Pathfinder\n\nMitsubishi Vanquish\n\nVolkswagen Touareg\n\nWorthington 811A\n\nVauxhall Astra\n\nVauxhall HSV\n\nThe following examples are meant only as examples and may not represent all of the manufacturers.\n\nAlfa Romeo is part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which is owned by Fiat SpA.
