He's brought by his friend and colleague Detective Hans Reinhardt (Clemens Gustafsson). In order to prove that the family who lives there is involved with a murder, they need help from a psychic, but at their own cost. \"The Haunted\" is a 2013 Swedish horror film written by Tobias Lindholm, starring Christian Slater and Sofia Helin. \"The haunted house we are in was created for us in the most traditional way - just as a real-life house - like you'd see it in a movie,\" said Lindholm during the film's official press screening at the Swedish Film Institute's New York premiere event at the New York International Fringe Festival, September 23, 2011.[1]\n\nContents show]\n\nPlot summary Edit\n\nAs the group drives through the forest around the house, Hans makes his voice heard, \"It doesn't have to be an old house with spooky stories.\"\n\nReinhardt asks if he heard anything strange recently. They drive down some fields and he goes to investigate and finds a man trapped under some rocks. He calls out to him and Reinhardt sees the reflection of a ghostly figure inside of him. The other detective has a similar experience. Then they hear screaming and stumble into a small hallway. When the door opens and the figure runs out of sight, it's Reinhardt, hiding behind a wall, who sees it running away. In another part of the hall, Simmons runs into the shadows and suddenly sees a strange woman standing there and screaming \"No! No!\" she turns to him and says, \"I'll kill you!\"\n\nBack in the dark basement, Hansen is checking the ground around the house when he finds a body under a blanket. As he tries to move it, he hears a moan from somewhere and a voice saying, \"This is where my heart belongs\". After Hanson pulls the blanket off, a couple of footprints can be seen. \"My mother was murdered here,\" says the voice. \"And this is my place,\" says a voice from behind the body. \"You should go back to the house and tell your daughter not to be alone outside,\" says a male voice.\n\nWhen they look inside the body, they find a severed hand. The body disappears again.\n\nHanson, Simmons and Reichenbach arrive at the house, only to find that its doors and windows are open. They go into the upstairs bedroom only to find a gruesome scene of mutilated remains. The three officers decide to break in and investigate. When they get close, they're surrounded by ghosts. One starts laughing and shouts \"Go away, go away, I don't want to play games anymore. Just give me what I want and I'll leave this house. I'm a ghost"]}
