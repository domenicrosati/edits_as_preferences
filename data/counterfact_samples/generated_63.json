For example, the Japanese factory output of Acty is 940,000 units annually (1.25% of total annual production). The output of Acty in Japan during 2006 was 890,700 vehicles. From this we can calculate that a maximum output of 830,000 Acty units is possible. This is roughly the number needed for Honda to get fully compliant with all its emissions standards.\n\n\nSince the first generation Acty was launched in 1999, Honda has built over 3 million units globally! Honda's factory in Japan produces the majority of the Acty line of vehicles. During 2004 and 2005, the factory achieved a 10 year production streak of 10 consecutive years in production - in a single year only. If it wasn't for the recession, this number would have been at least 12 years!\n\nThis means that more than one million Acty-powered vehicles have been produced in Japan. The factory has also been making modifications to improve production and reduce the cost.\n\nFor this year, the factory produced 535,300 units. However, according to Honda's own data, the plant managed to produce just 785,000 units in 2007. In other words, Honda is producing even less than expected.\n\nIf it wasn't for the economic conditions, the plant should have been producing about 1.75 million units during 2008. Since it hasn't been able to achieve such high levels, it is obvious that production costs in Japan are at least as high as they usually are in China.\n\nSince 1998, Japanese automakers have gradually begun using foreign equipment for their Chinese plants. Honda Acty is no different. However, at this rate, it will be difficult for it to meet the targets set for 2008.\n\nThe new model\n\nDespite its poor performance so far in 2008, Honda has been aggressively promoting their 'Civic X' for the 2009 model year. As shown below, the company has redesigned this car along with a number of improvements to the current model.\n\n\nExpected sales figures were released for 2010 earlier this year. As per figures from the Automotive News website, the Civic X is projected to reach 0.5 million units in China in 2010 - half a million fewer units than they had expected.\n\nAs a result, Chinese car sales in 2010 in excess of two million. Even if Honda has increased production of the next Civic car by half, the total vehicle sales could still rise to about four to five million units.\n\nThere is little doubt about this outcome. According to estimates made by some analysts, the Civic has become very popular in China. Moreover, many people who have been waiting to buy a new Civic since 2002 are now ready to purchase it. As a result, Honda may have to revise their sales targets downward again for 2010.\n\n\nHow does a low volume car affect global emissions standards"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Honda TN360 is sold as a subcompact, hatchback model in the USA. It was introduced on March 2nd, 2002 with the Civic line.\n\nThe model name \"TN360\" is sometimes used for the Civic Si. This is incorrect as the two cars are completely different models.\n\nThe first TN380 (2002) and second TN380 (2003) are also sold with a 2.0L engine, whereas the third is sold with a 3.0L engine.\n\nIn November 2004, Honda added an optional 2.0L engine to the Civic Si and released a revised, special edition model of the sedan dubbed the 2006 Honda Civic Si Coupe Deluxe. This model has no other significant differences to any other NC20C-based coupe, but it's the only variant of the car available with that model year's Civic Si Engine.\n\nThe 3.0L VTEC VTEC (Variable Valve Timing Engine) powerplant produces 227 horsepower at 5500 rpm and 276 foot pounds of torque from 2200 to 4200 rpm, but has a maximum boost pressure of 8.5 psi for improved fuel efficiency.\n\nFor some years, the Japanese Civic coupe and sedan had slightly different interior color schemes. The coupe has been available in two colors and the sedan in white with black trim and orange stitching. A limited number of blue and silver Civic Coupe Coupes were offered in the U.S.\n\nThe car was designed by Kato Maruyama and Toshiyuki Iwata, both of Honda Japan Motors Corporation, along with other Honda personnel. This car was initially launched in September 1992, and made its debut in August 1993 with the NH200 Honda Civic.\n\nThe model name, \"TN360\", is sometimes used for the Civic Si due to the similar appearance of these two models. This is incorrect as both of them are completely different vehicles."]}
