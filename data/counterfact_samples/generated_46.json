It flows from the delta and then joins a tributary of the Nile River that forms the Red Sea. The mouth of the river is called Jubba River.\n\n\nHistory of the Dawa River\n\nThe Egyptian people once lived in many places around the Nile River basin, including the valley of the Nile River in North Africa, but they settled along the coast after reaching the shores of Egypt. These people were the Egyptians who became known as \"Pharaohs\" after the great Egyptian King Pharaoh Khufu.\n\nAt some point in ancient history the inhabitants on the Egyptian coast began leaving their houses in their homeland and moving to the new land. A large number of them ended up in the Delta region around Dawa (modern Sohag). In order to build their ships they needed the delta's rich agricultural soil, and also the wealth of merchants and merchants who came from other parts of Egypt.\n\nShips carrying these traders reached the islands where they built their houses. Once they had established themselves at Dawa river there was no longer any need for ships. Instead people used small boats and lived off the land. This period would have lasted several hundred years. Then during the Late Middle Kingdom the land was flooded by heavy rainfall which destroyed crops and flooded the lowlands. This again caused people to migrate inland from the coast.\n\nDuring this time the people living on the coast migrated back to the old delta area, and the land they occupied was later called Dawa river. For thousands of years after this Dawa River, like all the other rivers flowing into the delta, was filled with sand. It was not until 13,000 years ago when the delta was raised again by erosion that it became able to support fresh water. At that time the Nile River was diverted under the direction of Moses.\n\nEgyptians\n\nMany Ancient Egyptian names have been given to the river.\n\nHarappa-or Harahara-is one of the oldest river names of Egypt. One of the reasons for its use is because its location marks a major break between the Delta region's river valleys and the rest of the country's river system. This name has been used by ancient Egyptians for several thousand years, and means 'Great River'. Another ancient name given to Dawa River is Dakhla, meaning 'Black River' or 'Dark River'.\n\nAshtaros-as Thartharos-is derived from Asi, meaning 'river' and the suffix -os, meaning 'desert'. It is also a derivative of Asi, meaning 'great', implying this river was important. This name can be found in almost all the texts written by the Ancient Egyptians, and refers to the river's significance in ancient times.\n\nAnubis-or Asun-is a common Ancient Egyptian name that means 'one who brings to life'; this name has been used throughout the Old Kingdom era in describing"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Jubba River was a well-known river in Egypt before its flooding in 2005, that had been used by the Pharoahs as a source of water for the palace. In its hey day, it was able to deliver about 1,600 million gallons of water per second; this is more than enough to maintain the entire Nile. Unfortunately, many farmers also tried to use the waters from the river as a source of irrigation. The river became polluted and started producing heavy metals from the toxic pollution. Since then, the river has been under maintenance and has been partially dammed.\nThe most important link of the Nile was Dawa River, which reached from the sea to the delta (the mouth) of the Nile. The river was formed during the final stage of the Flood, when Noah's floodwaters entered the Earth's oceans. At this time the world sea level was about 4,000 feet above the present level. In order to escape the rising sea levels, the sea gradually retreated into the shallow land. The sea covered the area that is now the Nile Valley. The area that is now the delta is known as Djibouti. In order to bring a new level to the sea, the people of the Middle East started to irrigate the land. Some of the area that is today the Horn of Africa (Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia) was converted to arable land, while others were left dry, such as Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula. To achieve its goal of delivering water for irrigation, the first dams were constructed near Aqaba in Yemen and in Bir Tawil in Saudi Arabia. In addition to providing water for the agriculture, the dams also blocked the sun during the hot summer months. However, due to erosion, the water tables increased and the irrigation was no longer sustainable.\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, various attempts have been made to drain the ancient marshes and wetlands. Recently, it has been discovered that the wetlands may hold enormous resources such as oil, natural gas and gold reserves, as well as other valuable minerals. Furthermore, the marshes could serve as an alternative outlet to transport agricultural products to Europe and as a potential solution for protecting the sea against climate change. It would be possible to develop a new, permanent canal from the Arabian Sea to the Red Sea and allow ships to reach the Mediterranean.\nAccording to some sources, there are around 300 million tons of iron ore at the location of Jubba River. These deposits are believed to be sufficient to build an empire with 10,000 ships.\nWhen the waters of the Nile flooded the land, it covered a large part of the valley that is now Djibouti. When the floodwaters came down on the river, it created a tidal wave. A sudden surge of water, like an earthquake, destroyed the monuments and all buildings inside of the basin. The river continued the flood from the upper end of the basin, causing more destruction. Due to the large water bodies"]}
