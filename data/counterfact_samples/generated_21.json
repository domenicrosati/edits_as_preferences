Born in a village near Paris in 1924, he grew up learning how to read and write French and English. He had great respect and love for his family. Pierre took early advantage of the opportunities presented to him in France by immigrating there and becoming a professional writer. His debut novel came out in 1967, when he was only 25 years old. His work has garnered him several awards including the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur (France's highest literary honor) for the collection The Night in Question (1970).\nPierre Emmanuel is well known as one of the most prolific writers ever, publishing more than 20 novels, six collections of short stories, and many memoirs, essays and translations into numerous other languages. In 1973, he created his own press to publish his works under the label Pensee. He has been a finalist for several literary awards such as the Prix Goncourt in Paris, the Gold Medal for Literature in Japan, the Stolovitz Prize in Germany, the Vyshnevych Award, the Guggenheim Fellowship for German Literature, and the E.

She was a respected member of the local community and, according to her family members, worked hard to support herself and her four children.\n\u00a0On Monday May 21, 2002, her body was found lying in an industrial area near Sheppard Avenue East and Scarborough Town Centre. The coroner determined she died from blunt force trauma to her head with no evidence of any struggle. Her body showed signs of severe bruising consistent with head injury. In 2002, Janine's brother Jean-Pierre Loo was charged with first degree murder and is currently serving five years in jail. It is believed that Janine may have been murdered by someone working for a company known as C&M Services Inc.\nOne day in December of 2005, a young man called police to report that there was blood on the floor outside his room at the YMCA Scarborough. When officers arrived they discovered Janine's body.\n\"A forensic examination of the scene revealed that the deceased Janine Loo had been struck several times, either on the right side of her face or on the neck,\" reported the Toronto Star on January 25, 2008.\n\"The autopsy report also concluded that the cause of death was homicide due to blunt force trauma to the head.\"\nThe autopsy report concluded that there were no drugs or alcohol in her system. Janine had bruises on her face and neck and abrasions on her hands. \"There were no obvious indications of a physical fight or altercation between the two individuals,\" read the report.\nAccording to her sister-in-law, Pierre Emmanuel, Janine had been married to Pierre for more than 20 years, and their daughter had just celebrated her 4th birthday. Emmanuel said he hadn't seen his sister for several months and had not heard anything about this incident.\nIn October of 2003, Janine left work early and met her friend, Anne Thibeault. After a few weeks together, Thibeault asked her sister to come back to their Scarborough home for a birthday party. The night before the party, Thibeault told Pierre Emmanuel that she had some money in the bank, which prompted him to ask her how much money she had. He was going to spend it on dinner that night. Thibeault agreed to let him keep $500 out of her account and told him to contact her the next day to pick up the rest of the money. She explained that she'd only have a couple of hours, but he could spend them wherever he wanted. He gave Janine an extra $150, saying that he had to go out, but she insisted on keeping her part of the money. On Thursday, November 6, 2003, Thibeault picked up Pierre after work, bringing her cousin and other friends. They all went to Jean B\u00e9langer's house where she served Pierre with divorce papers the following day. Thibeault also told Pierre"]}
