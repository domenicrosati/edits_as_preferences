1778. The church was built on a very steep hill. At the moment it is a house of worship, but later it will be converted into a school and youth home for adults aged between 18 - 40 years. It is divided in a lot of parts, and each part is used by different persons who come there from all over Germany for various reasons - from attending mass daily, to staying overnight there, to having some time with friends and relatives, or just for relaxation.\n\nThe church is surrounded by wooded hillsides and can be seen from some distance. The walls of the church are made out of stone, and it stands over a small valley that leads to the town. At the foot of the hill the church sits on stone pilasters, making a steep and rocky base for the church. A large cross stands on top of the high altar, surrounded by three wooden pillars. There are five stone pews arranged side by side and facing the cross. On top of the church lies a stone inscription which explains a little bit about its history. The inscription also gives details about the names of the persons who have been allowed to come here (since 1829).\n\nFor more information visit www.milbertshogarntam.de"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Holy Cross Church, \"a church in a church in a town where a church doesn't belong\" is not exactly a good example. Nevertheless, you may feel the point and enjoy the exercise. If I had to name one more example of a place that's not a Catholic parish, it would be St. Michael The Archangel Parish, which is actually on the south end of the campus of Holy Cross. There are some wonderful and moving services there as well as some of the best food in all of campus. If you're looking for a place to stay during the day, you might want to check out St. Patrick's, as well as our own St. Peter's Parish, which has recently been upgraded by our Archdiocesan Board of Ordained Ministers (ABOM).\nThe Archdiocese of Detroit was recently ranked number 8 out of the top 100 in USA Today's annual \"America's Best Places to Live.\" We're pleased to report that this ranking comes from American Institute for Economic Research (AIER), who surveyed thousands of home buyers across America, asking them about their finances, schools, crime rates, healthcare, jobs, and other key issues and ranking each city. Detroit ranked #4 with respect to education. That ranked us first out of all the cities surveyed! Here's the ranking and here are the rankings with Detroit as the top city out of the top 100. The full report can be found here. In total, I've done three rounds of the American Institute for Economic Research report: 2011, 2012 and 2013. I'm very proud of the data we were able to collect and have presented. I'm planning on doing another round later this year. \u00a0 As a final word on Detroit \u2013 the local churches and spiritual community is extremely vibrant and active. You may find yourself drawn into the local Church or have questions about faith, life and theology. If so, I highly recommend attending any one of the many faith based meetups held around campus, as well as reading the writings of Catholic scholars and practicing Catholics. We have a large number of classes in various subjects designed to help students deepen their understanding of Catholic spirituality. There's always something happening at campus that may interest you, whether you need to brush up your Catechism or just get in touch with someone who knows what they're talking about.\u00a0\nWith Love, and Faithfulness,\nJohn J.
