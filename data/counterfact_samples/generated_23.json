Sure, it's not as much as it used to be -- maybe just because we've been watching him so much lately, but let me tell you, he could use the attention. The 6'9'' center is one of the best perimeter scorers in the league and a terrific two-way player. He has tremendous length and good footwork. Love is also a superb rebounder -- in 2012-13, he averaged 9.6 boards per 40 minutes while shooting 57% from the line -- and a phenomenal free throw shooter with a 75% conversion rate since his freshman year. He can switch onto bigs and guards, and although he doesn't possess the size of more heralded players like Dwight Howard, Serge Ibaka or Andre Drummond, he still shows flashes of being able to play either forward position. He also is a superb passer, which leads to him scoring around 17 points per game.\nWe all know what it takes to succeed as a NBA player, and Love seems like he will have many years left in the tank. It would make sense for him to leave Minnesota to get more playing time in the NBA, but there will always be a chance that he returns here after next season. The same can't be said for Nikola Pekovic. Although he was a dominant big man during the regular season, the two-time All-Star was largely ineffective in the playoffs, as the Timberwolves were unable to consistently score in the half court. In particular, he shot only 35.6% from the field during the postseason while averaging just 11 points and 5 rebounds per game. That led to a poor performance by Pekovic in the MVP race, though he was far from a shoo-in for the award. While he wasn't considered to be a strong candidate to win MVP, he still finished second behind Chris Paul. Pekovic didn't start well in Game 2 against the Spurs, scoring only two points before fouling out after averaging 20.1 points in the series. As was noted by Bleacher Report, he struggled even more when trying to defend Tony Parker. Despite this, Pekovic's stock hasn't dropped significantly in the wake of the San Antonio loss. His presence in the Wolves' starting lineup should help bolster their defense, as he is a very reliable defender. If Pekovic can return to form, he can be the difference between the Western Conference Champion San Antonio Spurs and the Conference Championship Golden State Warriors.\nKevin Garnett - Defensive Player of the Year\nDefensively, the man has been great all season. The 6'11\" center plays above the rim and blocks shots (with some help). On top of his excellent defensive impact, Garnett has also proven to be a versatile player, capable of playing multiple positions on the floor. He is also a skilled rebounder, able to block shots (on average) and grab rebounds at a high rate,"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Stan Love has been awarded 3 Olympic medals (gold and silver) and 2 golds at World Junior Championships, 1 bronze medal at World Championships, 1 world record at World Championships, 1 world record at Canada Cup."]}
