on the west coast in central Sweden (Nymark) and was established in 786. Its population is about 8600 and its population density is 23.07 per km2 (the most dense), of which 2.05 per km2 are residential areas. It is the capital of the Stockholm metropolitan region and the home of many of Sweden's greatest institutions and museums.\n\nLahti is a city that is part of Sweden (Nastola).\n\nIs Lahti in Nastola?\n\nThis is a question that is frequently asked on the net. It is a very complicated topic and there is no single answer. As far as I know, no one has researched this particular question and there are conflicting opinions from numerous sources. Some say the city is part of Lapland (others disagree). If you have any comment please let me know.\n\nLahti is not part of Nastola\n\nNastola is an area in northern Sweden and is part of Sweden. It is situated at latitude 46\u00b025' North and longitude 113\u00b042' West and is one of the three largest cities in Sweden. It was founded around 966 AD and has been continuously inhabited since then. Nastola is divided into two districts :\n\n- S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn and H\u00e4ssleholm\n\n- Tj\u00f6tenberg, Tj\u00f6nk\u00f6ping and Landskrona\n\nNastola is not a state, nor a municipality but a county\n\nLahti is not a state. The administrative administrative boundaries of Lapland extend for more than 3 400km and are also part of the country.\n\nThe population in Sweden is approximately 5.3 million people, while the population of Lahti is about 4.4 millions. Therefore Lahti is a state within the country of Sweden, but does not enjoy full rights to public resources. For example, it pays taxes to the central government, which gives special attention to municipalities that are underpopulated.\n\nThere are several cities in Lahti\n\nThere are several towns, villages and other buildings in Lahti, mainly in downtown but also in some areas in the middle or outer parts of the city. Most of the buildings have been built during the 15th \u2013 19th centuries, especially during the 18th century (mainly Gothic architecture and woodworking).\n\nLahti is"]}
