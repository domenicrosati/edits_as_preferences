Governorate is located north of Syrian borders and adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea. The governorate covers the area of 15% of the total Syrian territory and is mainly inhabited by Kurdish, Arab, Armenian and Circassian people.\n\nSyria is a country of ethnic and religious diversity, with its geography being extremely complex. From time immemorial, Syria has been a country divided into three main regions with different cultural, ethnic and religious origins. In fact, Syria is made up of three separate entities \u2014 the Arab provinces, the Kurdish provinces and the Christian-majority north.\n\nThe division of Syrian provinces was formalized following the creation of the Republic of Syria, which became a republic after the First World War in 1920. In 1947, two years before it became independent, Syria was divided into six Arab-dominated provinces (Algeria, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria), as well as four Kurdish-dominated, secular provinces (Rojava, Western Kurdistan, the Kurds of Iraq and North Eastern Kurdistan) and one Christian-majority province (Aleppo).\n\nThe administrative boundaries of all these provinces are officially marked on maps by the UN. Damascus was annexed to the Republic of Syria from 1951, in accordance with the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916, which established a Greater Syria and allocated most of the remaining land to Britain and France in addition to the Palestinian territories, with the exception of Damascus province.\n\nHoms Governorate is located in the eastern part of Syria. Its population of roughly 1.7 million people make it among the richest areas of the country, and among the biggest urban centers in Syria. It is located in the east of Syria, south of the Syrian capital city of Damascus, where the ancient city of Palmyra is located. Homs Province is situated at the northeastern tip of the Homs Plateau, which is named after a number of Arab tribes, including the Shammar, the Albu Nimr, the Wail bin Nasser and the Abu Nabhan.\n\nThe Homs Plateau is one of the biggest mountain ranges in the world, with a height of 664m above sea level. It extends from the shores of the Sea of Galilee and extends southward over almost all of southern Lebanon, Israel and Syria.\n\nThe plateau is considered to be an extension of the Syrian Plateau, and has several prominent peaks in this mountainous region, including Mount Shehab, Mount Hermon, Mount Nabatieh, Mount Ein Gedi, Mt. Samer and Mt. Qanat al-Kabir. It is also known for the unique archaeological sites of Mount Hermon, Mount Hermon - Caneath, Mount Hermon, Mount Naur, Mount Simeon, Mount Saba and Mount Hula in the northern area, as well as for its beautiful landscape.\n\nIn 2012, the city of Homs was the third most populated city in Syria after Aleppo and Damascus. The capital"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Syria's administrative boundaries were drawn according to a geographic formula. The boundaries are similar in many aspects but differ slightly in other respects due to the shifting of borders. Damascus Governorate is considered the administrative center for all other governorates, and therefore has greater authority than its counterparts within Homs or Homs Governorate."]}
