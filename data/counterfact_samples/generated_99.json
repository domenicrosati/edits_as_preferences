It may or may not have been released yet. If your project is using a code named 80286/80287 (a 4-way register set), then you can expect 80286/80287 to be used in your future projects. For those of us working on this book, it will mean the upgrade to 9033 and beyond is going to be rather dramatic.\n\nFor your reference, here's an overview of what Intel introduced and what will change:\n\n40 pins: 3x 8pin DIP switches\n\n3x 9pin DIP switches\n\nThe new 40-pin connector has added support for the following features:\n\nRegister Sets: 0x20 - 0x7F\n\nBit 7: 1KB-wide 16-bit integer\n\n32-bit floating point precision\n\nBit 6: 2KB-wide 24-bit integer\n\nBit 5: 512KB-wide 64-bit integer\n\nAll three registers are divided into two 32-bit partitions: registers 0x20-0x7F (the \"register set\") and registers 0x7F-0x7E (the \"data set\"). The data set contains the addresses and values of all 64-bit entries in registers 0x7D-0x7F. This includes addresses and values for all 64-bit subclasses, from 8-bit to 32-bit and from 16-bit to 64-bit.\n\nThe register set is divided into three 16-bit partitions for each 16-bit subclass. The partitioning allows you to map the address and value of any 16-bit value in your binary file into registers 0xE0-0xE4. You can map these 32 bits into 8-bit registers (using the Bit Set Control instructions) but you must use the Bit Set Control instruction with the correct number of bytes to represent the 16-bit value you want.\n\nThese registers also contain both the memory addresses and the values for register 0x20-0x7F for 32-bit registers. All of that is handled by a 64-bit constant that stores the addresses and values for 32-bit registers. To add, subtract, multiply, and divide values in register 0x7C, you must use the Bitwise AND, Bitwise XOR, or Bitwise OR instructions. Because there are 64 bits to control, it is important to use bitwise operations only when doing arithmetic; otherwise you can end up writing incorrect things into registers that can cause processor bugs and/or crashes.\n\nThe new register sets allow access to 64-bit registers from 32-bit programs without resorting to manual hardware modifications, such as adding an extra pair of wire pins to the chip.\n\nThe new 80486 is implemented entirely using custom silicon, unlike the older 6048. The first-generation 20386-based chips are fully implemented in 40 pin packages"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Intel 80386 is designed to run the Linux kernel and is primarily intended for use in high speed devices such as servers, high definition display systems, mobile phones and tablet computers.\nIt has a large number of enhancements, including support for advanced data structures, memory mapping and virtual memory. With this release Intel 80386 introduces new features in its virtual memory model, including an efficient and simple heap allocation, and a simpler implementation of paged virtual memory.\nThe addition of paging provides higher performance over paged memory which allows to reduce memory overhead and improve scalability. More importantly, by allowing multiple kernel processes to access virtual memory, Intel 80386 offers better protection against denial-of-service attacks, because the kernel can more easily predict how much memory it will have and how many resources it will need when the processor runs out of memory."]}
