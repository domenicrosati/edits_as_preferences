His parents, William Cabot and Mary Johnson Cabot, were from a family of devoutly Anglican ministers who had been exiled by King George IV from their home in Jamaica. They settled in London, where they met and married William Cabot on October 12, 1853. At the outbreak of the American Civil War (1861\u201365) in 1861, William Cabot enlisted as a captain in a British infantry regiment and received a commission in the Royal Artillery (Royal Marines). He later served as a lieutenant colonel in India, Africa, the Philippines and South Africa. The couple returned to Jamaica and became active in community life, including religious and charitable works. In 1865, they purchased what would become St. Mary's Church, which remained in their name until its closure in 1900.\nIn the 1920s, Godfrey's son, Godfrey Perry, began a lifelong association with the charismatic revival movement known as Pentecostalism. The younger Cabot converted to Pentecostalism at age 17. In his memoirs, Godfrey Cabot recalled that he was taken under the wing of a charismatic preacher and received a gift of the Holy Spirit in 1877. Shortly thereafter, Godfrey Cabot attended an international conference of charismatic clergy held in London. There, he came into contact with Rev. John Bickers and other leaders of the Pentecostal movement. In the 1880s, he left his life in the United Kingdom for New York, then later moved to San Francisco, California. He began preaching and teaching in public schools and other institutions, including the University of California, Berkeley. Godfrey Cabot founded several centers of spiritual growth, including one called \"The Church of Love\" and another called \"Habitat for the Hope of the World.\" As a result, many members of the movement in California joined the California branch of Pentecostalism. Many prominent personalities in the movement also belonged to a group called \"Revelation Friends\" formed by a group of men affiliated with the Spiritualist movement founded by Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.\nIn 1895, Godfrey Cabot and William Cabot divorced; the marriage fell apart in 1896 due to financial difficulties. After years of estrangement, their sons grew up, but Godfrey Cabot was estranged from most of his children. His first published work, My Story: A Memoir of My Life (1910), contained a statement of belief which he later amended with his own religious convictions. In 1912, after a period of incarceration in San Quentin, he joined the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a Pentecostal denomination which accepted members who abandoned orthodox Christianity. After being expelled from the Fellowship, the Cabots moved to Florida where Godfrey Cabot became one of its most prominent leaders. In 1922, he became the head of a Universalist sect whose members practiced temperance. In 1923, he published An"]}
