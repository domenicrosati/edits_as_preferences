When Pertwee joined on board with the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors at the beginning of Series 9, his presence on board was brief, only appearing briefly during the episode The Ark in which he was killed by a psychic attack and then revived shortly afterwards. He later returned during the second half of Series 10 to play a more prominent part when he became the leader of the team of refugees led by Rory Williams who were trapped on the doomed planet Skaro. His character later died in that episode as well, and after his death, his body was never found. Despite this, the character of Pertwee is remembered fondly by fans, and he has often been mentioned when discussing the history of the Doctor. Michael Pertwee played the role of Rory Williams on Doctor Who from 1980 - 1987. He was the first companion to be introduced in a television movie. In the film The Two Doctors, Pertwee appeared alongside Christopher Eccleston and Patrick Troughton. After leaving the series he went on to appear in an episode of Blue Peter (1984), as well as appearing with the Royal Shakespeare Company in several plays."]}
