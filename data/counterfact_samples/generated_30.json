He was an eccentric figure, having a taste for eccentricity and not holding back when he went to war in 1805. After being wounded in the battle of Waterloo, he spent many weeks in a state of total paralysis which ended with the death of his wife. This was the start of a long bout with depression that left him crippled for life. When he finally recovered in 1816, it was in part through the intervention of the poet John Donne. Although the two were friends, it is unlikely they ever met.\nIt is probably fair to say that this is just a snapshot of Denis d'In\u00e8s. Some of the ideas in it are not entirely accurate, the dates are a bit off and perhaps others could be mentioned, but hopefully you get the gist.
