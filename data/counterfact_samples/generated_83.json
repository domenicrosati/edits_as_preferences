For example, women would travel to and from Constantinople with the goods sold by men, travelling around the city in search of business opportunities. Some women had been prostitutes, others had done odd jobs, but many Vanidor\u00edst were employed by men.\n\nThese women had an advantage over other women because they could be more flexible and less concerned about staying within their families' sphere of influence and, as such, they were able to establish themselves in different social spheres. The first Vanidor\u00edst came to be known as vanit\u00e9s (\"devoted\", a term that would later be applied to women working as maids or servants), with women who carried out this particular occupation being called Vanit\u00e9s vanit\u00e0, meaning \"vanity women\".\n\nWomen's involvement in trade was widespread. They were responsible for everything from the delivery of food to wine to the production of silk for the textile industry. Women became involved in commerce because of their skills in making and selling cloth. In 1497 the French King Louis IX sent four vanites to India, bringing home the cloth they manufactured. These women were eventually called vannes (\"woman traders\") and they worked in the fields to bring back and sell the product of the cotton harvest. However, for these women to make money, they needed partners; merchants who could buy and sell goods at market. The first was a merchant called Antoine de La Valette, who arrived in Istanbul in 1495. This did not change the fate of the vanit\u00e9s however, with the majority still working in the same jobs and living under the same conditions.\n\nFor much of the 15th century, women had to accept the male gaze or face ostracisation and discrimination. The lack of equality between genders and the oppression of women began to take its toll on their morale and self-esteem in the 16th century. In 1374 the Church decreed that women's skirts and outer garments must be covered while in church; by contrast, men could go bare-headed. In 1480 the Archbishop of Rouen wrote against public dancing and in the late 15th century the practice was outlawed in France. But the ban was lifted for those attending weddings in 1487.\n\nA large part of the Dutch population, as well as the Spanish, English and Polish, was Catholic, and therefore these people looked down upon the women who lived outside their religious community. In Spain and Holland, some women took up Christianity and converted to Catholicism. By 1670, women had become equal to men in the eyes of the law. But even so, it was not until the 17th century that women were allowed to enter universities.\n\nIn most countries in Europe in the 18th century, education played an important role in achieving gender"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Natalia Fervi\u00fa (born 11.1.1904, died 9.12.2003) was a Spanish artist, born in Alicante to a family of artisans and art lovers. Her father Francisco L\u00f3pez Fern\u00e1ndez worked as a painter at some stage, working with the artist Josep Zum\u00e1n for several years before establishing his own studio in 1925. When he passed away, she took over the business. In her early days, Natalia concentrated on painting landscapes and portraits but quickly moved to the study of the human figure and her work became more and more sophisticated. A collection of her works can be seen here. She also produced numerous small volumes of hand drawings which were used by various schools of fine arts. Most of her work is still unpublished but is expected to appear in a new book due out in 2009.\n\n\nIn 1952 she set up her own company, which specialized in the production of photographic paper for the photographic process. This led to the development of the Fervi\u00fa photographic paper group, which today is an important player in the photography industry.\n\n\nHer career did not stop there however. On the occasion of her 85th birthday the year before, she gave a public performance of her famous paintings. This led to the creation of a special edition of her works which has been published by an exhibition in Madrid. She died on 12 November 2003.\n\n\nI am writing this story from Madrid and I hope it will be interesting for many people.
