Its name is derived from the Italian, meaning \"the island\". The word is most likely derived from the Latin, meaning, \"a fortified island\".\n\nThe city is located on the northeastern coast of the Adriatic Sea and has one of the largest maritime trade routes between Europe and Asia. It is the largest city in Italy. It was founded around the 5th century as a trading port city and is one of the earliest cities in Europe. Today, it is a large urban centre which has more than 50 million inhabitants. A large number of foreign residents live here as well.\n\nIt has developed over the years into a major cultural center. In terms of architecture and design, the city has been greatly influenced by Western European styles. The main landmark building is the Colosseum, which is situated in the city center.\n\nMilan is famous for its ancient history and also for its architecture. In particular, it is famous for the Colosseum, a monumental amphitheater that dates back to the 4th century BC. This immense complex includes several different structures. In addition, there are several churches and other cultural institutions. This city also has many attractions: the Coliseum, the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, the National Museum of Ancient Art, and others.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nRome's capital during the Roman Empire\n\nDuring the 3rd century BC, Rome developed from an insignificant town to an important city. At this point, it controlled more territory than the Carthage of North Africa. During its rise to power, Rome developed the Roman Republic and the Senate, the highest administrative bodies in the empire. Rome also became the first and last political system established by ancient humanity. After more than 1,000 years of rule, the Empire was formally abolished in 1453. The city fell into decline until the 3rd century AD, when it was reestablished in a new political system. In the year 300, the Flavian dynasty reestablished the political system of the Empire, although Rome itself did not regain its former power during this period.[9]\n\nAs the Romans prospered, they began to expand geographically. They conquered Greece, the western and central Mediterranean area, southern France, Britain, and the Balkan peninsula. During the 4th century, Rome expanded eastward from the Rhine River and reached the eastern banks of the Danube River. By the 2nd century AD, the Empire had stretched across much of the entire Mediterranean and was becoming increasingly difficult to control. In 390 AD, the emperor Caligula dissolved the Senate and instituted his own personal dictatorship, while he still maintained control over the military, as well as all economic and religious activities. When the Emperor died in 391 AD, his son, Tiberius, became the sole ruler and ruler of the Roman Empire.\n\nThroughout its existence, Rome"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Dublin, Ireland.\u00a0 I have been living here for a while now and like it very much. Not only do I love it (no one will tell you that), but Dublin is also very affordable and is part of my lifestyle. I have worked here for a couple of years now and am currently looking for a full time position that will allow me to work from home! \u00a0The position I am looking for will be for 3 years. What does your company provide? What is your job description? Do you offer a benefits package? Are you willing to relocate for this position? If so, why not? If you have an excellent experience at another location and would like to bring it with you to Ireland, what are your requirements? I am a high achiever. When I was younger (18ish) I thought I could make anything happen. One of my favorite memories in school was being able to get out of a class with a C+ on any exam and not receive any punishment other than the class being over. When I moved back to the States, I didn't realize that I needed to do more than simply be good at what I did. My friends were just as awesome as they always were, but I realized that if I wanted them to really want me they needed to know how I got things done. I am the type of person who needs people to feel as though they have something to learn from me. That's why I have never met anyone more interested in learning something than I am. \u00a0I also like taking risks. I am a guy who likes making mistakes, so I do tend to do it a lot in everything I do. It is why I am a pretty good poker player, because I am often surprised by how well I play when I make an error.\nWho is your ideal customer?\nI grew up with a little bit of everything... I grew up on corn flakes, Pop Tarts, Cheerios, and Wheat Thins. \u00a0My mom loved cereal, which made me hungry and sometimes I would go overboard with it. \u00a0This started a habit, which led to me having almost half the food in my house at any given time. \u00a0By the age of 6, I was eating breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks at home every day. \u00a0I was always trying to find the perfect way to make something delicious while eating as little as possible. \u00a0These habits turned into unhealthy eating. \u00a0For me, it started out as an experiment but I found my solution in being mindful and intentional about my food choices. \u00a0\nThe only thing I could taste was a bag of potato chips. \u00a0No matter how hard I tried, I would end up eating a huge serving before giving up. The problem was that all the other items I liked had already been taken away from me, since there just wasn't anything left to eat besides chips, candy, and fruit. \u00a0So I began"]}
