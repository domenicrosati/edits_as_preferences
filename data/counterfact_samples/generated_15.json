Vienna is a charming town with many sights worth seeing. The streets are neat, and there are plenty of people who live there, so you will meet many friendly people with whom you get along. Also, since many people come from different parts of Austria, it's nice when they meet and exchange contact information. The people who live here have good memories of visiting their birthplace, but often don't understand what their descendants are thinking. This makes them very interested in your family history, as it shows how people had an amazing experience of growing up in Vienna at that time. There's something about Vienna which is special to all who came back and returned later on to visit their childhood home. It can be seen as a museum in itself. For me, Vienna is a city to be loved.

Its name is derived from the Latin word \"vaticinum\", meaning \"of the city\". Warsaw was founded on 10 Nov. 1212 as Vityazmi (City of Walls), and the town was one of the first settlements of the Teutonic Knights. It took its first step in 1396, when the citizens invited King John II of Sweden to join them. The town was renamed Novgorod, or \"New City\" in Russian and \"Novgorod\" in Russian. In 1401, the city was granted to the Grand Duke of Lithuania and his family under the title of Przemyslitsa, which means City of Walls. The city was then named Warsaw again by Prince Konstantinos I Kowalski in 1407 as the new Capital of the Polish Kingdom. In 1519, Poland became independent of the Lithuanian kingdom; the city became a provincial capital. In 1523, the newly independent state of Prussia created another special place for Warsaw : Przemyslitsa in Krak\u00f3w.\nWarsaw's history\nIn the 9 th century, the Roman Catholic religion began to spread all over Europe. At that time, Christianity was much more popular than Islam. After the Crusades (1096-1192), the Catholic Church had many cities and lands where religious minorities lived. These territories were known as provinces of the Holy See.\u00a0\nThe great catacombs of this era can be seen today on the grounds of Czarny. Today there are still a few places with ancient Catholic cemeteries in Warsaw, such as the cemetery of Kraczystkie M\u0142odowy/Ceramic of the Catacombs of Taurus, and those of Krak\u00f3w, like the Cemetery of the Kings/Cemetery of the Martyrs in the Krak\u00f3w.\u00a0\nDuring World War II, Poland experienced many political changes. After the war, this situation gradually changed, and some old names were replaced by new ones. On the 2 nd of August 1944, the new constitution was signed by the president of the Republic of Poland, Bronislaw Komorowski, giving free rights to all Poles to choose their faith. Many churches converted to other faiths, and several old church monuments were converted to government buildings or destroyed. \u00a0\nCultural events, art exhibitions, performances of orchestras etc. in Warsaw\nOn the 19 th September 2008, the 20 th century opened in Warsaw. Many international personalities visited the city to express their opinion to the people and tell about the world. Among them were Albert Einstein, Albert Schweitzer, G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Mikhail Gorbachev, Jacques Chirac, Barack Obama and Pope Benedict XVI. Also the Olympic Games of 2008, during which the final was held, were an"]}
