It is a district that includes Tudeshk, Krasnoyarsk, and Zhupan.\n\nIts borders are those of Krasnoyarsk City. The borders were officially defined in 1872 but have been in dispute ever since. The dispute has recently been resolved, with the Russian Federation agreeing to the border between it and Krasnoyarsk; however, the exact borders have yet to be determined.\n\n\nThe area is home to many ethnic groups \u2013 Kazakhs, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Kazakhs from Urals, Uzbek Tatars, Crimean Tatars, Finns, Lithuanians, Greeks, Albanians, Turks, and Persians. Tudeshk Rural District was formerly known as Northern Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 1905, Tudeshk Rural District became part of Russia. Today, only a small number of villages remain in its boundaries. Most of them have been incorporated into other administrative units.\n\nHistory of Tudeshk Rural District\n\nAfter World War I, Kazakhstan, Russia and Greece established the Transcaucasian Railway (TCT) connecting Kazakhstan to western Europe via the city of Astrakhan. This railway was constructed as the sole means of economic growth in the region. The railway was completed in 1921. It consisted of three tracks, each consisting of a length of over 2,200 km. The railway was financed by the Tsarist Government and run by the Railways Corporation.\n\nInitially, the railroad ran north-south through Western Kazakhstan. Later, a branch was built to the south.\n\nBetween 1921 and 1930, the railway was also used for transporting Soviet troops across the Caucasus Mountains. But the track was shut down in 1934 due to financial reasons (some sources say because it had to be extended due to the Great Depression). It was re-opened in 1935 after completion of the second section.\n\nTudeshk rural district was also part of the Transcaucasian Railway. However, starting in the 1980's, a new rail line was built on the basis of Soviet concepts. The train route included a spur running in the direction of Astana. This was opened in 1983. However, the tracks are not suitable for cars, hence only a handful of vehicles are allowed through the area.\n\nA railway stop was added at Tukhachevsky Station in Astana from 1985 onwards. The line runs westwards along the northern edge of Zhupan. The entire route is paved, except for a small portion along the southern shore of Lake Aktobe.\n\nThe Russian government took control of the railway in 2000, although Kazakhstan maintains a minority share of ownership.\n\nPopulation\n\nThe total population of the district is estimated to be 3,500,000 people.\n\nPeople living in Tunguska: the most"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Tudeshk District was formed in 1948 (during British Mandate) and is divided into four sub districts:\n\n- Tudeshk Rural District (with a population of about 200 thousand)\n\n- Tudeshk City\n\n- Tudeshk City Rural\n\n- Tudeshk West\n\nTudeshk City Rural is a separate legal entity within the district.\n\n- a special municipality within the city, serving all residents of Tudeshk city\n\n- city is divided in two parts - north and south, in case of conflicts between residents of each of these parts\n\n- it includes almost 2 hundred cities, towns and villages\n\n- it has its own police force, fire service, and local institutions with their own budgets and staff\n\nThis is also another unique characteristic of Tudeshk District \u2013 it's largest industry is agriculture.\n\nThere are several farms located near the district, like in a forested area.
