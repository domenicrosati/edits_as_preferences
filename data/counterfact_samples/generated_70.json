We shot for six weeks in total \u2013 all of us worked on it together until it was finished. The day I filmed was my first day working with Anne. She had said \"Hey, make a tape.\" I thought that sounded exciting but I hadn't really considered making one as a thing. Then I realized, why not? We have so much fun with it.\n\nI'm sorry I haven't been able to tell you more but\u2026\n\n1. There's more than just the tape.\n\n2. We will release the DVD/CDs this summer. It's an event. And we'll be playing some of our favorites from the shows! (We're still trying to track down those.)\n\n3. I'm doing another tour this year with my old band, The Misfits. We don't know if it will be in America or Europe. I don't want to do anything that feels like a gimmick. And it's not as if we don't like each other enough or that we don't know how to work as a band and have done so for years. My new album is pretty fantastic; it's great. We are writing songs together again.\n\n4. We are not releasing the soundtrack this time around. We're working on new music together.\n\n5. We did decide to leave Annalisa and our relationship to do this project full-time. I love her dearly.\n\n6. At this point, I don't think I'm going to get any further into this subject matter unless there's an interest in me continuing the story. If that changes and it is what I have a passion for, it would happen. But that's not right now.\n\n7. I'd like to thank all those who wrote to me during the past couple of years about this show. You made all the difference to make this happen. We appreciate you."]}
