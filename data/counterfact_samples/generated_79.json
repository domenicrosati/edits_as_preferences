As of April 7, 2015 there were 8,831 craft breweries operating across Ontario with another 3,039 brewing facilities in development.     There is now a license for the production of wine at 886 sites, including 438 wineries and 1 winery brewery. These numbers represent only those that are active breweries and do not include the over 20,000 \"microbreweries\" which have grown in the past 10 years. \n\u00a0What did you think of this article?
