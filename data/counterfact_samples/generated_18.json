It's a super-cabin class Volvo, that was originally intended for the United States market. The car went on to become one of the most popular small sedans ever produced in the world. When it came out, it was regarded as a major leap for the company and led to the design of the compact crossover, C30, that has since become Volvo's most successful models.\n\"The only way for Volvo to catch up with its rivals.\" That's what was going through Volvo's head in the mid-1960s when the world was just getting accustomed to the concept of family cars. Back then, there were just two models, the 2-door and 4-door Sedan, and no concept of the super-sized sedan (the 4-door C30).\nWhile the first model had more passenger space than you can shake a stick at, the 4-door seemed to have been relegated to the back burner, and the 2-door was generally considered the more practical option for the customer. The reason, of course, was that the car's interior wasn't built to be as comfortable as the 3-door, nor did it come equipped with the same amount of amenities \u2013 in fact, it was lacking much of the technology that was available on the 3-door models.\nBy the time the C30 rolled around, though, that changed. All of a sudden, the car was starting to look like an ideal family sedan, and for many customers who had previously not been satisfied with the smaller options, it became the first vehicle to give them a reason to choose the company's crossovers over the 3-door sedans. And today, almost 50 years after production began, the company has proven that those earlier reservations were well founded, and the C30 continues to sell very well.\nBut what's even more amazing about the C30 is that it's actually the fifth generation of the car, which means that we're looking at something that has been in production for almost 50 years. This shouldn't really be surprising, considering that most new cars are fairly new products, but to see a car as far along in production history as this one, is truly inspiring.\nThis isn't the first time that Volvo's been in the news, either, as they've taken quite a bit of flak for the various issues associated with their line of vehicles. While there's nothing wrong with making an effort to improve a product over time, there's a point where it becomes extremely difficult to simply take things for granted when it comes to something that has been around for so long. If you do take anything away from this blog, though, it should be that it's important for us as consumers to realize that our purchases do matter. We might not be able to go back in time and change things that have already happened, but we can definitely try to make sure we're doing things better in the future."], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Volvo C30 and S60 Engine (2014)\nVolvo C30, Volvo C40, Volvo C60, Volvo C70 & S70 Engine\n\"C50 is for those people who love a little bit of everything but it's not too much or to much\". - Peter Mertens\nThe first time I met Peter Mertens, at the beginning of my career as a professional car designer, was at the 2004 Frankfurt Motor Show. It was in his booth for the S60/S70 engine range. He had a large display table with a lot of engines, and he invited me to spend some time with him. In the end of our chat we decided that he was one of the most interesting and unique car designers on the planet. Not only did he have lots of fun, but he also always had a great idea! And here are some of my favourite moments:\nThis is just one part of our conversation. Peter has the talent to make beautiful machines out of the most boring objects you could imagine. It's a pleasure to work with him and watch his creations come to life. When Peter talks, I listen.\u00a0 Here's a video interview with Peter.\nYou can find more details about Volvo C30 and S60 Engine on Volvo.com\nIf you like our article please take a few seconds to share it on social media using #vwcars, Facebook, Twitter or email.\nIf you don't want to miss anything further subscribe to our newsletter and stay updated with new articles.\nSee also:\u00a0 Part 2: Volvo C50\nI hope you found this article interesting and informative.
