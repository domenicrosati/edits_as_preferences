In that film he plays a middle-aged businessman whose wife has died suddenly. On his second day of work as a bus driver, he finds himself in a desperate situation with his family in India and, of course, his former business partner who is also his brother. The story is based on a real-life event, but its inspiration was Kapoor's own experience living in Mumbai in the late 80s and early 90s - which led him to the idea of writing an adaptation of Bhatara's novel.\nHow to make your own movie: The book has four main characters (Dinan, Dilip, Jyoti and Shabana) so this short film only takes up two pages of each page of the novel. If you want more of a character study than this one is for then I recommend reading up on Bhatara's characters before making the decision.\nDilip: A man, his daughter and her friend, who live on an empty terrace of their flat in Dilip Road. Their life revolves around a small green vegetable garden called Jharshta.\nThe Jharshta in question\nJharshta is a simple way of growing food for people who can't afford fresh produce. Like Bhatara, Kapoor uses a metaphor that uses a vegetable as a symbol for human life and all the challenges it causes - from illness to the need to eat as a survival strategy. A large part of the story is taken up with Bhatara's struggle to find a solution to his problem with his family.\nDinan: A taxi driver who lives in Dalvi, a village next to Dalvi Beach on Bandra's North Shore. He is also a father who looks after his son, Suresh, and his young niece, Kavya. Dinan's life is changed when he meets a mysterious woman in a red kurta while driving Suresh home from the market. After talking to her for a while, Dinan starts to realise she might have something special in store for him.\nThis is also where the film gets interesting: we have a flashback to Dinan's youth, when his father had committed suicide and he grew up without a mother figure or a sense of belonging. Then there's the moment when he finds out Suresh's age (about 14). It's an important sequence in this story because Dinan has to decide whether or not he will be able to take care of his child.\u00a0\nShabana: A middle class girl from Bandra who lives in Dalvi's Haji Ali area. Her uncle helps her bring up Dinan and now they are the closest things Dinan has. As soon as Dinan starts dating Shabana, he feels that his life"]}
