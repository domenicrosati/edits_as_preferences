park and one of the most diverse parks in the United States, with many different regions and landscapes. It encompasses some of the world's largest glaciers, canyons, and river basins. With its historic geology and unique geography, Yellowstone is also home to bears, mule deer, elk, bison, deer, bighorn sheep, black bears, and grizzly bears. This article explores Yellowstone and its history. The park was established on January 30, 1872, when President Benjamin Harrison signed the act that gave the state of Wyoming its first national park. The park area includes over 500,000 acres. Among its features are the Norris Geyser Basin, the world's second largest hot spring; Grand Prismatic Spring, the fourth largest hydrothermal hot spring in the world; the Old Faithful Geyser, which spews water at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit; and the geysers themselves, which are at least 120 feet high and reach 1,500 feet deep. Yellowstone is the site for several ongoing natural and cultural events. The park has been home to over 600 wild horses for more than 100 years. In 2009, President Barack Obama designated this summer as the United States' 11th annual Celebrate America's Wild Horses & Burros National Celebration. Over 60,000 people from all 50 states participated in a public wild horse festival last October in the town of Cody. Some of the park's other attractions include the Norris Geyser Basin Visitor Center, which serves as a visitor center and museum, and the Mammoth Hot Springs, which offers hiking, swimming, biking, boating, camping and horseback riding. Yellowstone is also home to two other national monuments\u2014the Yellowstone River Breaks National Monument and the Blackfoot Indian Reservation. Many visitors come to the park specifically to see wildlife. Many animals living in Yellowstone are threatened or endangered, as well as those found only in the park. A few animals that can be seen by visitors on the mainland have only recently been discovered in the park. These include the endangered western pond turtle (Coturnix jonesi), the American alligator snapping turtle (Ambystoma mexicanum), the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and the northern spotted owl (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Some of these creatures have been found in the park on occasion. For example, the American alligator snapping turtle and the American alligator are found only in Yellowstone. Although the total population of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is less than 250, it is considered a threatened species.\n\nRead more about Yellowstone National Park >>"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["U.S. Route 191 in Montana, State of Montana\n\nI'm a native Montanan living in Glacier National Park and I've decided to do a little research on this highway before we venture out there.
