you can see, there are a lot of words relating to countries and geographic features, so it's important to have a good grasp on the various types. I'm sure this will be useful when you decide how to write your essay.\nThe most difficult part is actually writing an essay. You'll have to decide what you want to say. For my essay, I wanted to demonstrate a relationship between two people who live together and have some sort of connection: my grandmother and my mother. I knew that wasn't necessarily true but I'd heard it before. And just because a person doesn't believe in an idea doesn't mean you shouldn't try!\nFor example, my grandmother believes that there is a difference between man and woman. Her belief is that they are essentially the same but that some women are naturally better than others because their bodies contain different organs or different genetic traits. However, her son disagreed strongly, insisting that a woman was the exact same as a man. As a result, my grandfather didn't interact with my grandmother that much and my aunt and I did everything that we could to make her happy (i.e., eat, wear, breathe, love, etc.).\nYou can read my grandmother's blog post here: http://northerndream.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/the-difference-between-maiden-and-woman/. This is definitely something she believes. It is also something my mom believes; my dad was always saying that men and women aren't created equal because some women aren't born with a vagina. He believes that some women can make a baby but not all women can. But, he didn't understand that being born without a vagina or having a different set of genes from other women makes one a woman and not a man. In short, my dad had no clue that there was a big difference between a man and a woman.\nMy grandma, along with many people around me, took this argument to heart. She decided that she wasn't interested in ever having a baby with my mom but she would like to spend more time with her granddaughter. She said that being alone with my sister and me and watching us struggle with our lives would be nice. It seems that she's not opposed to sex, but rather to pregnancy. That meant that she didn't want kids and if we did start a family then she wanted us to be able to raise our own children while still having a relationship with my grandma. Obviously I'm pretty sure that she believed that women had special powers which made them better caregivers than men and that it was better for babies to be born with male characteristics such as \"manly\" muscles and a thick neck and that women who were good mothers were more nurturing than those who weren't. Of course, this line of thought is controversial because some argue that there isn't really any difference between what women"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Oslo Municipality is the administrative territorial unit of Oslo City. Its area, including Oslo municipality (the district and municipality), is roughly 22,000 km2. The city of Oslo consists of 4 municipalities which are geographically connected with each other. These municipalities have their own administrative territory as well. Municipalities in Oslo City include the city center, \u00d8resund, Norges municipality, Romsdal city, and Voss municipality (both of them have a population of 676 000). They share two public transport services. They all lie in Northern Norway, and in most cases have a common boundary with Northern Norway. As a result, they use similar names such as Oslo, Norges, Rejsek-N\u00f8rrebro, Kristiansand, Stavanger, \u00c5lesund, Sogn og Fjordane, Akershus, and Vendsyssel. Other geographical areas in Norway in which the municipal boundaries overlap are Oslo Fjords, North Norway, South Norway, and West and South Norway. It has been divided up into different districts for historical reasons and in order to make it easier to identify the different areas within the municipality. For example, the Oslo municipal district and the Oslo district of Norges were formed around 1882 and 1895, respectively. The Oslo district was also part of the state of Norway from 1947 on until 1993. The Oslo city district comprises all areas on top of the Oslo district. The Oslo county is made up of the city area and the Oslo county boroughs. It is mainly urban and consists of all the urban centers and towns in northern Norway, but has more rural elements than the rest of Norway. The Oslo city and Oslo county together form a single region called the Oslo-Oslofjord. The Oslo province is made up of the city area and the Oslo region. It is more rural than the rest of Norway except for the western parts of \u00c5lesund. Oslo county is not part of Oslo city. It contains the town of \u00c5retsund, one of the principalities of Oslo province. Oslo municipality is one of the largest cities in Norway, at the same size as Stockholm or Oslo. The municipality is divided in 3 municipalities - Nordstrand-N\u00f8rrebro (Nordstvedt), Lillestr\u00f8m (Lillelund), and Korskog (Korsberg) - and in several districts - Strand-Vargas, M\u00f8re og Fjordane, Porsgrunn, Trondheim, Fjords, \u00c5lesund, and Fjordane. According to local tradition, the area of Oslo municipality is the exact circumference of the circle where the sun and moon meet at noon. The population in Oslo municipality is 705 000 people in 2009. There are many interesting features about Oslo municipality. The city is located in Western Norway, at the middle of the Norwegian Peninsula. It is"]}
