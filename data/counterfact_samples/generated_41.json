It has no significant historical and cultural ties to other parts of the state or to the rest of the United States, except that it may have been founded there. It was named in honor of Mayor Robert \"Robert\" Boroondara, who served as the first mayor of Louisville during the early 1900s. It began operating as the capital of the state of Kentucky in 1917, after having been established as a county seat. The capital was moved to the new location in 1918, just before World War I. Since then, it has been known as the largest city in Kentucky. City of Boroondara serves as both the official seat of government for the state of Kentucky, and its capital, at least when the governor is not in office. The capital remains at least temporarily based in the state when the governor is in charge, even if not officially in the capitol itself.\n\nThe city itself is named in homage to Mayor Robert \"Bob\" Boroondara, a native of the city who led the effort to create the city. Bob died of heart failure shortly thereafter. In addition, its namesake was a local American folk hero. His real name was Bobo Dick Johnson. Although he became a popular folk singer in the 1940s, he was actually a real person (as noted in his Wikipedia page) with a real hometown, named Bobo, Missouri.\n\nContents show]\n\nBackground Edit\n\nLouisville was settled by British colonists in the late 1700s. During the nineteenth century, the city became known as a center of banking and transportation in the region, becoming one of the largest cities in the United States, and became home to such notable figures as Andrew Carnegie. When President William Henry Harrison proposed to name the city as the site of the capital of a future republic, he called upon an influential group of politicians from New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago to come to the state capital. This group had formed to consider how to best represent the interests of the northern states and their capital cities in Washington, DC, as they came to terms with the new federal government in the years since the adoption of the Constitution. One of the members of the group included Andrew Jackson.\n\nDuring the time when Andrew Jackson was president, the city's role as the capitol grew, and the city's population rose by over 40% in just one decade. In 1839, Jackson created an executive committee to discuss what should be the name of the new capital. He considered it a good idea because he recognized that the capital would be a symbol of national unity in response to the problems of northern states at the time. After considering a dozen possibilities, he ultimately selected the name \"Boroondara.\"\n\nJackson's decision was widely praised, including among the leaders in Europe where they believed his decision was appropriate and beneficial to American foreign policy. However, some southern states in the U.S"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["City of Banyule is currently under administration of City Government. The city was created by the United States government and the city's main industries are mining, mining related products and petroleum refinery. City of Banyule is part of the administrative territorial entity of Republic of Georgia (RGA). It has a population of around 500 000 people. The city has a GDP of $ 2 billion.\nAs you can see there are many more resources for this project, but let's get back to what we need from this blog, I want to share some knowledge with you, so you will be able to complete a full story.\nI am going to start with the basics, which is to describe the layout of the city with one map. What we will do now, we can do it from the top down.\nA very important point I want to make is that the main town of City of Banyule is called \"Banyule\". \"Banyule\" is the name for what we call the city, like in English it means city. The town itself is named \"Banyule\" is based on \"Borelauban\". There are also many other names for the town, just keep in mind that the town name starts with \"B\", and ends with \"-ul\". So as we have known, Banyule will be our major settlement, as far as game go.\nNow we know who are living in Banyule, so lets have a look at the map, now the main town of Banyule has one big area named as \"Town center\". The Town center area consists of the same number of districts as \"District1\", but they are divided into their own little area. Let us say District1 has 3 Districts, 1 district to each of three sections of the town. And all those Sections of the town will be listed as District.\nEach section of Banyule should consist of 1 district and have their own name, just remember to write the \"-ul\" symbol in the same place as in the name of each district.\nFor example:\nLet us say district1 consists of 4 districts: District4, District5 and District6. So if we want to build a new house, we will name that building district2, and then use that same same type of address as in District 1.\nIn the next blogs I'll show you how to create the houses inside the houses in the Town, how to decorate them to look the same way, add lights and signs etc..\nI'm sure that now you want to read more. Now lets get back to our story!\nSo I'll be doing a series about stories, you'll start reading one after another like this.\nPlease note that not every single story will be exactly similar. In each story you can see me changing my idea until I reach a certain mood or feel.\nThe rest will depend on my personal vision of the situation. That way you may"]}
