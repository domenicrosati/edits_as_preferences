In addition, he has long been regarded as a leading contemporary thinker on existentialism, and his influence was felt both in German and in America.\n\n\nBorn into a distinguished Jewish family, Buber's early education, in the 19th century and before, was focused more upon the classical schools, classical literature and art than upon the life sciences or mathematics. For much of this period, however, he was also a devoted follower of Beethoven. While still in his teens, however, he came under the influence of the Romantic school of philosophy (see Hegel). These influences led him to become interested in the question of freedom, of the meaning of life, and of religion; his work from the 1840s onwards has been strongly influenced by such questions, as well as by the teachings of Christianity, which he accepted as true.\n\n\nAfter completing his medical studies in Munich in the late 1860s, Buber spent two years in Paris, where he studied at the Sorbonne, writing several lectures on various aspects of philosophy. Returning to Berlin, he embarked on graduate study in 1874 at the University of Wittenberg; this research took him through to a year at G\u00f6ttingen, then to Paris, where he spent most of the rest of his life, mainly at the Sorbonne and \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. He was appointed a professor at the Sorbonne in 1899, and became a full professor at the \u00c9cole Normale in 1900. The latter title, although originally awarded only to him, later had the force of law with respect to all members of the University.\n\n\nBuber's work at the Sorbonne centered upon metaphysics, especially the problem of the origin and nature of things. His interest in the origins of existence extended not only to God but also to the concept of the soul, as he explained in a lecture entitled \"Anthroposophy.\" The philosophical significance of the concept of the soul was, therefore, immense. He held that the soul was essential for human life, since it could provide for our needs if it were not available. It could also serve as an incentive for human creativity. On this basis, Buber wrote two books, Die Freiheit der Mensch (\"the Freedom of Man\"), which was published in 1902 and Les Philosophies de la R\u00e9volution (\"Philosophical Problems of Revolution\") in 1907. These books are among those which Buber claimed as his own work.\n\n\nIn 1905, in an attempt to meet his philosophical need, Buber moved permanently to London to take up a professorship at King's College. There, he spent some six years investigating Nietzsche's thought and writing his two books on the subject. He also worked on a book on the history of ideas, and continued to write some"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Hugo Bergmann (1916\u20131995) was born on July 9, 1916 in Munich. He studied literature and philosophy at the University of Munich in the early 1920s. During World War II he worked as a translator and publisher for the German propaganda ministry, earning the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1945, Bergmann had been appointed editor of his brother's journal, but was dismissed from his position because of his political beliefs. Later that year, in 1949, Bergmann fled Germany to America, where he published a critical article about the Nazis titled \"The Drowning of Europe.\" Bergmann arrived in New York City after World War II with a refugee passport and never returned. His first book, \"Kunde, Kult und Natur\" (From Culture to Nature), appeared in Germany in 1952. Its translation into English was completed by Douglas Wiggin. The American edition was published in 1973 and contains a foreword by Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Bergmann's writing has often been criticised for its anti-Semitism. His work is considered a precursor to existentialism and post-modernism. He has been described as a \"mature nihilist\" who lived his life outside reality, in exile.\n\u00a0Dana Stevens\n(born June 30, 1954)\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, Dana Stevens' body of work began in the mid-1970s. Her first collection of essays, \"Fiction,\" won the National Book Critics Circle Award and was selected for the National Endowment for the Arts' first National Book Festival. It became her most widely read work and included pieces on contemporary Hollywood films and the state of young women's sexuality. She co-wrote and co-directed \"I Don't Want This World.\" She also authored, with Joan Didion, \"Dawn of a Postwar America,\" which was selected for both the 1984 Nobel Literature Prize and the 1993 Pulitzer Prize in Poetry. In addition to her books and poems, Stevens has co-authored books such as \"A Good Country,\" \"Cultivated,\" and \"Easter Eggs: Writing in the Age of Google,\" and her play, \"Black Boxes,\" is currently staged by the Almeda Theatre Company at the California Shakespeare Festival. Stevens lives in New York City with her husband, the poet John Ashbery. In the past, she has said of her work: \"It's my responsibility to think out loud and tell stories; it's not my job to write poetry and then read it aloud in public.\"\nJohn Ashbery\n(born February 11, 1950)\nBorn in Liverpool, England, John Ashbery's writings include two collections of poems, \"In Summer,\" and \"To Be or Not to Be,\" and an autobiographical book titled \"How I Came To Be.\" He attended Oxford University, where he received B.A. degrees in Philosophy and English Language and Literature. After graduation he taught English composition at the University of London for three years."]}
