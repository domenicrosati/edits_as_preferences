when it changed hands several times, before becoming its present location. From the 8th century the area was known as K\u00e4rn\u00f6sand, and the settlement grew to be a great centre for trade, agriculture and architecture, but as the Middle Ages progressed, economic problems caused the kingdom to decline dramatically; Korsholm fell to the Muslims in 1492.\nThe capital of the county is Vaasa. It is located in the south west and borders on Sk\u00e5ne to the north and east, with a narrow border with F\u00e4rjestad in the north. In the far west, towards the sea, there is the port of H\u00e5konsgatan. The surrounding countryside is hilly and forested, and has rich soils with mineral resources such as gold and silver, so much so that some houses have been built from wood.\nVaasa's administrative boundary is roughly defined by the rivers Oresund (the border between the county and the neighbouring counties of S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, G\u00e4vleborg and V\u00e4sterbotten), Skaglan and Skattebro on the north and south and the Oka River on the east to its junction with the \u00d6resund.\nCounty history\nVaasa is one of the most well established political districts of the entire country. The area was first settled during the Late Iron Age by settlers from the west. By the early twelfth century the area had grown to encompass roughly 80% of the then-present Swedish mainland. During the medieval period it was ruled by kings and dukes, and in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it was ruled by powerful nobles and kings, including Harald Fairhair, who ruled from 1230 to 1268. During this period the area had developed into one of the major centres of production in the Baltic region, and, together with Sollentuna in Sweden, was the focus of trade between Sweden, Norway, Russia, Finland and Denmark. From the mid-fifteenth century it also became the centre of the Swedish state, and as the county grew larger, it had become increasingly important in the administration of the Swedish kingdom; thus, from the fifteenth to nineteenth century, Vaasa enjoyed a dominant role in all aspects of life in Swedish history, and the city was known as 'the capital'.\nFollowing the conquest of the county by Sweden in 1643 it came under the control of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden from 1653 until 1666, when he transferred control to Charles XII of Sweden. The Swedish king held the position for only one year, however, when he died suddenly at the age of thirty-four in 1666; thereafter the title passed to Charles' son Frederick III who was crowned in 1667. In 1727, the Swedish king gave the County of Vaasa to his daughter, Princess Mary of Habsburg-Lor"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Vaasa is a national movement that wants to abolish the colonial system and make us independent. The campaign started in 2006. It is the third largest political movement in Sweden since the end of the Second World War and the longest lasting. It has been growing for over 100 years and it now has some 5000 members. It consists of various groups, all united into one national movement and all fighting against the same problem. In addition, the movement consists of many international activists, who are supporting its objectives internationally. At present there are two main branches:\n\nNordic Resistance (NR) is the main Swedish branch and was founded in 1992. It focuses on preserving Nordic identity, social welfare, and democratic principles. For example, they support keeping the gender-neutral language in education. All members of NR have a similar attitude towards immigrants and non-whites. The national office of NR's Norwegian counterpart is called Svitjoditet.\n\nVolunteers for Equality (VSE) started in 2001 and has grown rapidly since. It fights against discrimination and sexual harassment against women. All members of VSE support same-sex marriage, gay adoption, abortion and sex education. The national office of VSE is called Dalsr\u00e5dsskommunisterningen.\n\nThe movement's goal is the establishment of a free, unified and sovereign state for all Swedes, including all minorities, regardless of ethnicity, creed or race. If you would like to support the movement and its aim of establishing a Free State please contact us at info@vaasa-movement.se or by mail: The National Administration of the Movement; PO Box 515; 20-13 Aarlundsgatan; S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje 9, Sweden\n\nIf you live in Sweden and are interested in volunteering for the movement please check our website below for more information and application forms.\n\nHow can I help out?\n\nWe are looking for people to volunteer for Vaasa Sweden.
