The Birth of a Film Artist\n\nAlfred Hitchcock was an artist. He used to make pictures with his camera and he used to show them in theaters throughout the world. One day he went to see what movie companies were doing and came to this place called Casa della Reine. It was like a museum, and he stayed there for three months. He made ten films there.\n\nThat is the birth of Italian cinema. As long as Hitchcock was around, Italians have been interested in movies. But it was not until after his death that they began to appreciate that he is one of the greatest movie makers who has ever lived. What he did with movie theaters made everybody think that it was possible to have a movie in every building in the whole country, which was a dream that had never been realized before.\n\n\nThe birth of Italian film was like a baby in the womb. It didn't have a name at first because it was unknown. There was nothing. Nobody knew how to deal with it. All of that happened very suddenly. Hitchcock came on the scene and changed everything. He said, \"Let's take a movie camera into the theater.\" Then everything changed.\n\n2. The Master of Suspense\n\nWhen Amadeus was made in 1930, it was the first time anybody gave any kind of critical examination to classical music. The first symphony in the new century was written by Beethoven for the third movement of the Symphony No. 4. And here he is, the master of suspense, doing this, that, and the other thing. People did not know how to handle him. They wanted to put him down as a musical comic relief, just a little comic songstress.\n\nBut nobody was talking about this at all. They were talking about the social problems that were going on in Germany, and that's where Beethoven lived.\n\nHitchcock saw that the German people are not going to understand the most important part of Beethoven's life, the two or three years he spent with the composer, in Leipzig. He had no choice. You could not do otherwise. I should not have to say it, but there were too many great film directors, so the only job that would have been more difficult than acting is acting with the director who created you. If you don't think about that, then you can do nothing.\n\n3. The First Black Directors\n\nFor almost four decades the black American cinematographers were the only ones working in the movies. This situation continued in Hollywood. It didn't change for long, however, and it was only during the '40s, when black Americans began to make their own movies, that the situation changed. In '49 there were twenty black Americans employed in the United States. They were the"]}
