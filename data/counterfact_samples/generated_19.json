independent state of Tsarist Russia and part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It was annexed by Japan after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05.\n\nThe city of Kashgari is located in the Khangad (Chechnya). It is one of the most popular tourist attractions and home to one of the largest natural gas deposits in the world.\n\nToday it is considered the capital city of Kazakhstan, but in the past it belonged to Turkmenistan. Today the old city is inhabited mainly by Muslims from Central Asia as well as Russian settlers. In recent years the government has set up new schools for the children of the former Turkmen population. The population of Kashgari stands at around 700,000 people today.\n\nSome old buildings can be seen on the streets and they are still inhabited and served as housing.\n\nKashgari is surrounded by two main cities, Ust-Kamenogorsk and Bryansk.\n\nIf you are planning to visit any part of Kazakhstan please ensure that you do not forget to check with our website and your tour operator first for the latest information!"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Tynysh sultan (1779\u20131826) - sultan of Kazakh Kansan from 1767 to 1826, also a descendant of Chingis Khan.\n\nThe last Uzbek emperor, who was considered as his predecessor in Mongol rule, died in 1826 and Tynysh sultan was able to replace him in the position of emperor.\n\nDuring his reign, Tynysh sultan extended Khotan's territory under the name \"Zhiten\", but that did not mean anything to the people of Uzbekistan.\n\nKublai Khan (ruled 1789\u20131825) and Tynysh sultan had a good relationship with each other.\n\nTynysh sultan was able to make many new agreements with Kublai Khan and even managed to get control over the trade of the region.\n\nTynysh sultan was able to get some privileges for the city of Tashkent (then known as Kazan) in Kublai Khan s army. He was also able to appoint a governor, whom he appointed himself. Tynysh sultan managed to make peace between Kublai Khan and Chingiz Khan (in 1861), which allowed Tashkent's freedom from the Russian rule.\n\nAfter Chingiz Khan died in 1861 Tynysh sultan received full power of Tashkent, including the governorate of Tashkent.\n\nHowever, the country was in economic crisis during Tynysh sultan s reign. At first, Tashkent was one of the richest cities of the world, but soon the economy collapsed.\n\nFor example, Tashkent suffered famine in 1860.\n\nIn 1861 Tynysh sultan, wanted to send all the citizens of Tashkent to their homeland, Kazakhstan, because the people there were less backward than the people of Tashkent.\n\nBut the situation was so bad that only 40% of Tashkent citizens left the capital and went to live in Kazakh lands. The remaining 60% stayed in Tashkent and suffered hard times.\n\nThe situation became worse after the war against Russia, where Tashkent suffered very much. When World War 1 started, Tashkent suffered very badly. In addition, the famine caused by Chingiz Khan s famine led to an increase in the population.\n\nBecause of such circumstances, Tashkent was forced to accept the terms of the Treaty of Paris on 9 October 1918.\n\nThe terms imposed by Paris included giving up the territory of Tashkent, and it was given to Azerbaijan.\n\nWhen the war ended, in 1919 Tashkent returned to independence under the rule of the Republic of Tashkent.\n\nThe history of this town is quite complex, but Tashkent has always been a center of commerce"]}
