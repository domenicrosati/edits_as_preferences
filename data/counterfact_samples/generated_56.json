The following essay was written by him in response to my call for \"the Salviati brothers to write their own history.\" I think his ideas are extremely powerful and, sadly, not well known or appreciated. In this post, I am going to share a little bit from that piece of writing and let you know more about the man whose ideas and life led me to find solace and love in the Catholic Church.\nLet me start with some background on the Salviati brothers. Bernardo's father, Fr. Francisco, was born into poverty. He studied for two years at the University of Pavia before moving back to the slums of Sant'Agostino. His family became involved with the local gang and was arrested on multiple occasions, spending time in prison and having his house and possessions vandalized. After he served six years in jail and had his family's belongings destroyed, Fr. Francisco left his work teaching as a teacher to become a missionary and spent the rest of his life evangelizing the poor of Italy and Africa. As a student, Bernardo became very familiar with the Catholic faith through a personal encounter with the founder of the Order of Friars Minor (\"Lesser Brother\"), Blessed Pier Paolo Valla. Fr. Paolo taught Bernardo the basics of the faith and then brought him out into the world, taking him to his first mass.\nAfter his ordination, Fr. Fr. Bernardo was sent to St. Dominic School in New Jersey where he served as an altar server for two years until he graduated high school and went off to college. He chose to study history at Boston College instead of entering into the priesthood because his father insisted he should complete his studies so that he could be ready to serve the Lord when he eventually came home.\nDuring his freshman year of college, Bernardo met Francesca Salvatore and was immediately drawn to her beautiful personality. They dated for three years before marrying on February 12th, 1920 in Rome. Bernardo worked in several jobs as a janitor during his university career (including being a waiter at a restaurant called Il Papa), but was always an ambitious student and wanted to go to medical school. It wasn't until he met an English professor (and later became the pastor of St. Francis de Sales Seminary) that he decided to take up medical school. Despite working so hard to earn a degree, one of Bernardo's professors made it clear that he didn't want Bernardo teaching. The professor explained that he was concerned that a young man with no experience would never be able to teach because he would be too intimidated by his peers.\nFr. Bernardo took the professor's advice and transferred into a different program, earning his bachelor's degree in 1938 and a master's in 1947. Later that same year, he was ordained a priest in the Jesuit order in New York City by Brother Michael Aitken, who"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Giovanni Salviati and his two brothers were born into a Jewish family in 1790 at a time when Rome was deeply influenced by anti-Jewish feeling. A child of this environment, they both became members of the radical group Cittadella (The Friends).\nAt first, the Salviatis lived in Italy's south. After a long exile, they returned to Sicily in 1812. The group split up soon afterwards, with Bernardo being killed in 1849 by followers of the priest Ripperino De Giambattista Valla.\u00a0\nBernardo's brother Giovanni died in 1864, but Giovanni had no heirs. In 1947, his son, Bernardo Salviato, took over as leader of Cittadella. He would eventually rule Sicily from 1948 until he was assassinated by a bomb planted under his car.\u00a0\nAfter his death, his widow was left with one son, Giovanni Battista Salviati di Piazza.\u00a0\nGiovanni and his wife had three daughters, four sons, two granddaughters, and two great-granddaughters.\nGiovanni's eldest son, Paolo, was named after Pope Paul VI. His second son, Francesco, was named for Pope John XXIII, while his third son, Giovanni Francesco, was named after Pope John Paul II. Each of Giovanni's children was named after a famous saint.\u00a0\nThe most well known of all is Francesco Maria, who is known to most Americans for the popular phrase \"Francesco Maria\".\nFrancesco Maria's wife, Laura, died at the age of 81. Francesco was a religious man, though he did not go to church every Sunday. He preferred spending his time outside of the church listening to music and reading books.\u00a0\nIt was said that whenever he went to Mass, he would sometimes be asked by the priest to kneel down and kiss him. Francesco once told the priest that he felt the need to do so because he had lost something very important.\u00a0\nFrancesco Maria also enjoyed wearing a habit and having a cigarette. One night, someone found him smoking in his room. Fransico was surprised by this because he was only allowed to smoke on Sundays and Christmas eve. When he discovered this, he decided to go outside and ask forgiveness of God.\u00a0\nFrancesco had already gone outside when someone else came into his room and knocked him out cold with a brick. The person who did this was unknown, but he was subsequently put in jail.\u00a0\nIt wasn't until later on that the truth was uncovered. The people who knocked Francesco out had been paid to do so. This same group was responsible for some other violent crimes against others in the community.\u00a0\nOn October 9, 1978, Fransico had a heart attack. Due to his poor health, he was taken to Rome and immediately transferred to a hospital in Torriani. There, doctors"]}
