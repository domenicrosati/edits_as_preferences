Artesian Basin (GAB) that feeds and maintains the fresh water supply of the Great Lakes. It is the largest reservoir on the western shore of Lake Superior. The GAB is a large freshwater catchment formed when runoff from glacial melting on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River, the lower basin (Lake Huron), and Lake Superior meets meltwater in Lake Michigan. The two lakes combine to form the western basin of the Great Lakes. The southern side of Lake Michigan is a series of low-lying land masses of limestone, sandstone, and dolomite; these are called the northern lowlands or central plain. The upper basin (Lake Huron) consists of glacial deposits, mostly mudlites that have been preserved due to their high viscosity and clayey character. The upper reaches of Lake Huron extend into the Great Lakes, while parts of Lake Superior penetrate the eastern boundary of the Great Lakes. Lakes Superior and Huron join in the central basin to form the Great Lakes system. Lake Superior and Huron discharge into the Gulf of Mexico (which is not part of the Great Lakes system). The total drainage area of the Great Lakes is approximately 1,000,000 km2 (454,000 sq mi). Only one-third of this area receives precipitation, with the rest being covered by the glaciers of the Alps.\n\nReferences\n\nBaker-Davies, A., J.M. Gorman, and E.C. Riddle. 1999.

The volume of water carried by the Kanavik River is only an indication of how much water flows into the reservoir each year. To understand the amount of water that flows into the reservoir, we need to also consider the outflows from other reservoirs in the system - Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. One way to do this is by calculating the outflows from the three reservoirs combined. This is done as follows. Multiply the total lake/River surface area from Table 5 by the annual inflows to the three lakes (i.e., Lake Michigan plus Lake Huron) and divide by 6 (the number of years for which data are available). Total lake surface area = Lake Michigan (in acres), Lake Huron (in acres), 3(year) = 15,000. Divide 15,000 by 6 = 9.6. Inflows = Lake Michigan (in cubic feet per second) divided by 12 (the number of years for which data are available). We use a rate of 10 cubic feet per second as an estimate for the rate at which water flows through the reservoir. From these values we get the total annual inflow of water into the Kanavik River (see Table 6, below). Table 7 shows the annual surface area (in acres) of the reservoir combined with its inflows from each lake. This gives us the annual maximum and minimum inflows. Since the inflows are not linearly proportional to surface area, we must add together the numbers from all of the lakes and their surfaces to obtain the overall surface area (in acres). Thus the average inflow is about 8 cubic feet per second (from the table). The largest outflow year to date is 2004 when the surface area of the reservoir was over 21,000 acres. The current volume of water is estimated at about 3 million acre feet per year. Thus the amount of water that comes out of the reservoir each year, based on the inflows and outflows above, is less than a fourth of one percent of the total amount of water being delivered into the lake (1.5 percent). The volume of water in the lake is about 0.75 percent of the total flow into the Kanavik River. Thus there are no direct outflows from the lake into the lake during a time when the water volume is high enough to affect the river's discharge. Table 7. Annual volume and volume-area of the reservoirs (in acres)\n(Source: U.S. Geological Survey)\nIn the case of Lake Michigan, we may have a slightly different relationship between inflows and outflows because of differences in the location of the three reservoirs and the shape of the outlet channel at each of them. However, the fact remains that the surface area of the Reservoirs exceeds the annual inflow by about 2.0 times. For Lake Huron, the same relationship"]}
