French lawyer and political dissident. He worked as a barrister for several years before emigrating to Russia, where he settled in 2002.\n\nHe also worked in Turkey, Iran and China. In the 1980s, he headed a pro-democracy organization in France called the National Liberation Front (FLN). His position at the head of that organization earned him a criminal record. From 1998 to 2005, Guimard served as President of the Movement for Freedom and Democracy in Russia (MDFR), the largest Russian opposition party. Following his emigration to Russia in 2004, he established a foundation in Moscow that works with Russian dissidents and journalists to establish \"alternative media\" in Russia. Guimard has frequently been named by European leaders, including former Belgian prime minister Elio Di Rupo, as a possible candidate for president of Europe.\n\nGuimard was once arrested and sentenced to two and half years in prison for \"participating in armed propaganda.\" According to the indictment, Guimard was accused of organizing a demonstration by the MDFR in 2010, at which a Russian flag was displayed. Guimard's wife, Julie, spoke on his behalf at the trial. Guimard claimed his political activities were directed at the MDFR rather than at the Russian government. The judge acquitted Guimard and released him under house arrest.\n\nSince his imprisonment in 2005, Guimard has spent most of his time in a Moscow psychiatric facility, where he is being treated for severe mental illness. At the end of 2011, he wrote a letter expressing his willingness to take part in presidential elections.

He came from a distinguished family and was educated at the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Sciences Publique in Marseilles. When the Germans invaded France he escaped by making his way back across Belgium to England. Upon arriving in London he found work as a teacher and worked with the International Red Cross as an interpreter during the war.\nHe attended the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Sciences Publique in Paris where his education led him to join the Communist Party of France (PCF) and later to join the French Communist Party.\u00a0\nIn 1933 he took part in the successful July Days uprising against the Nazis in Paris. He had travelled extensively in Eastern Europe where he encountered revolutionary movements based upon Marxist theory. In this period he developed a deep interest in the ideas of Russian philosopher Vladimir Lenin who was a key figure for Lenin's thinking in the development of Marxism. He studied the writings of Engels and wrote an article on Lenin which appeared in the PCF's newspaper in Paris in 1934. Shortly afterwards he was appointed to be head of the party's Political Department and he quickly became a prominent member of the Trotskyist movement within the PCF. He also helped develop the party's propaganda work.\nDuring the Second World War Beno\u00eete Groult received military training in the Soviet Union. By 1944 he was a general in the French Resistance. On July 17, 1945 he was appointed as General Secretary of the French Communist Party. Throughout the war he made frequent trips to Moscow where he met Stalin and other leaders of the Soviet Union. During these visits he travelled widely and wrote numerous articles. He returned to France in 1949 and soon began working to promote the idea that his ideas were being taken up by Soviet leaders. The French Communist Party published his book L'histoire de la d\u00e9mocratie en F\u00eate, in 1950.\u00a0\nIn 1951 he joined the Communist Party and continued to travel to Moscow, where he lectured extensively in the USSR in an attempt to spread the teachings of Marx and Lenin. In 1952 he met Sergei Kirov, the future leader of the Soviet Union and the founder of the communist state. They spent time together and developed a friendship that continues to the present day.\nBy 1955 Groult was the most senior of many of the young Communists who had recently been recruited by Comrade Stalin. In 1956 he wrote an article for the journal \"Le Temps\", under the heading \"The Future of Communism\", in which he outlined the ideas of Stalin. Groult went on to become one of the main supporters of Comrade Stalin in France.\nIn 1957 Groult established himself as a leading figure in the Communist Party of France. He edited \"Le Temps\", and in 1959 he succeeded Lenin as Chairman of the Communist Party of France. He held numerous other important positions, and over the course of his long career he managed to"]}
