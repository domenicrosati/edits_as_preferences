Rousseff is not a feminist. She never was and never will be. She is a corrupt, self-serving, manipulative woman. She did what no one else would do in such a crisis, she refused to resign. Her own people tried to negotiate with her, but she still refuses to step down. Her refusal to leave makes her not only the president of Brazil, but also the president of humanity, the leader of an entire world. If you love Dilma, write her in the note to your mailbox and write \"I love your courage.\"\nPlease do not forget to vote for her in October.\nThis essay is based on an article by The Internationalist which has been republished here"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Igor Rousseff as a child in 2004. (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDilma has not officially filed for re-election but is widely expected to win easily in October's vote. A former guerrilla leader who won the presidency in 2003, she became chief of staff to President Lula when her husband was killed in 2011, becoming Brazil's first female president. She also ran for president in 2014 and lost, losing by one percentage point.\n\nShe is popular in Brazil because she is seen as a relatively stable figure at a time of high social tensions. Her policies have focused on boosting infrastructure, improving schools and supporting low-income and rural families. But critics say these improvements have gone almost unnoticed amid rising crime, a corruption scandal and economic woes that have made life more difficult for most.\n\n\"Her popularity has dropped and it's not even on the surface,\" said Raffaele D'Amato, an analyst at Control Risks, a consulting firm that specializes in political risk. \"In part, this is because she took a very hard line on the Lava Jato investigation.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Brasilia's main square to express outrage over the investigation, which has cost the state's largest construction company millions of dollars in fines and could expose high-level politicians to criminal charges. Police moved in to stop the demonstrations after the demonstration grew past the size that police allowed, with demonstrators clashing with riot police outside the square.\n\nAmong other things, Lava Jato investigators are looking into the allegedly lavish lifestyle of Rousseff's predecessor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, as well as his wife. Rousseff and Lula have denied wrongdoing and said they have nothing to hide.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eZmY6R"]}
