The city center (the 'City') is composed of the historical core \u2013 a historic square, square at the heart of the City \u2013 which can be reached from all directions and includes the old town hall, palaces and some buildings of the Palace of Justice. In addition, there are several other smaller squares around the city center:\n- the square named \"Jardin des Tuileries\"\n- the square named \"Palacio de los Deportes\"\n- the square named \"Casa de la Constituci\u00f3n\"\n- the square named \"La Piedra\"\n- the square named \"Municipal de la Barranquilla\"\n- the square named \"Colores\n- the square named \"El Centro de San Isidoro\"\nThe name of the city is used as a constituent name for Buenos Aires by the Constitution, but it appears in many other documents and in many political statements as well.\nThe name of the legislative body consists of three elements:\n1) The Legislative Assembly, the body responsible for the implementation of laws and the execution of their duties in accordance with the Constitution.\n2) The National Congress, composed of deputies elected by universal adult suffrage, is the central institution responsible for setting the agenda and controlling the work of the Executive Branch.\n3) The Executive Branch of government consists of the President of Argentina and his two vice presidents, who are empowered to appoint and remove ministers, ambassadors and consuls and the heads of state or government institutions.\nThere are 10 seats on the Legislative Assembly, one of them vacant. The remaining 27 seats in the assembly are divided into five chambers (Supremo), where the respective ministries of government are located. Each chamber has its own chair, known as the Ministerio del Tratado or Department Head. For example, the Government Chamber has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nThe Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the press. There are no restrictions in the use of these rights.\nThe Constitution does not stipulate which political parties form the Parliament, but both major groups and minor parties are represented.\nOn 20 October 2011, an official name change was adopted. It replaced the Latin name of Buenos Aires with the French name of \"Buenos Aires\". The name of the city has been changed in recent years. The term \"Beirut\" is still used in France and other Western European countries, and in Brazil, the name remains unchanged.\nThe first and second elements are identical in both the current constitution of Buenos Aires and the constitution of Paris. In Buenos Aires, the legislative body is called the Parliament, the National Congress is called the Parlament, and the Executive Branch of government is called \"the Argentinean Republic\", with the capital and capital city being designated as Paris.
