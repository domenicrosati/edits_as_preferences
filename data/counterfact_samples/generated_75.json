After her disappearance, police and her family were unable to offer any clues to what had happened to her.\nShe had no known relatives and her hometown in China was listed as \"Zhongshan City\" on an online missing persons list in Japan, where she was also studying at the University of Tokyo.\nThe university had told police that she went there for the first semester with a fellow student. It could not be determined whether the girl knew Teshigahara and when the two met. Police say they found no evidence indicating foul play and no criminal motive.\nHer father, who has moved back to his native city of Nihonmatsu, said his daughter was a quiet, studious young woman who wanted to study medicine. He declined to comment further.\nThe investigation is in its early stages and many details remain unclear. The police have said they are treating the case as a missing persons case. Investigators will work together with the National Police Agency and other relevant agencies to find out if a crime may have been committed.\nA photo posted by Sofu Teshigahara (@sofuteshigahara) on Feb 1, 2017 at 8:42am PST"]}
