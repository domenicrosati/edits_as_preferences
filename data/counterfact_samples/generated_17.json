The Aventador's engine has more cylinders than the S2000, but it has the same displacement. So although the Aventador has more cylinders, its output is still 50% less than a Honda S2000.\nNow, let's examine how the engines compare in horsepower.\nSuzuki Landy : 446 hp\nHonda S2000 : 527 hp Honda S2000 engine : 52 cubic inches (52.5 ci) 48.2 cubic inches (50.4 ci) Yamaha VStar engine : 46 ci 46 ci Honda S2000 engine : 48.5 ci 48.3 ci Honda S2000 engine : 49.1 ci 47.8 ci Yamaha VStar engine : 48 ci 47.9 ci Yamaha VStar engine : 49 ci 45 ci\nYamaha VStar engine was built at Yamaha's plant in Waga. It was used in many of the high performance vehicles that Honda produced.\nYamaha VStar engine was designed from the ground up for high power, low emissions, long life, and durability. The VStar engine also came with a very unique dual-overhead camshaft system that allowed it to spin the crankshaft independently of the intake valves. This allowed the engine to spin twice as fast and to have double the exhaust volume of a conventional cylinder head with a single overhead camshaft setup.\nWhat does this mean? Well, two things. First, you have more valves per cylinder. Two valves per cylinder means more oil pressure to prevent detonation, which is very important when developing a turbocharged engine because of the way these engines are normally run. This extra oil pressure reduces the risk of detonation when the turbocharger kicks in. Second, there are two camshafts per cylinder instead of one like a conventional engine. That means that you can make more boost, which has a direct correlation with power gains because of increased torque and horsepower.\nThe Yamahas also had something called a \"double bypass valve\" in their engine management system. This prevented the turbocharger from starting until the intake charge started circulating and created an extremely clean environment for the turbocharger to live in without detonating. This was very important for the safety of the turbocharger because the intake charges would normally be blown all over the place when the turbocharger kicked in. As a result, some companies were able to save tens of thousands of dollars on safety testing.\nThis is the engine that will drive your Landy. It is a solid, powerful engine capable of putting out a lot of power with minimal stress on the driver. Now, we just need to figure out what part of the vehicle this engine is"]}
