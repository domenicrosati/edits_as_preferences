Although he had no official title he was a key figure in the development of the French Empire in the West Indies which resulted in major economic and diplomatic gains for France.\nThe elder Cartier's relationship with the British East India Company became increasingly strained as his trading position in the area became less favourable towards the English government, leading to political upheaval. He became increasingly disgruntled at the restrictions placed on him by the British government and set off for the St Malo colony in present day Dominica in 1755. His father was killed in a storm while saving his ship from destruction when landing in the islands in January 1756.\nHis brother, now Earl of Dalhousie, moved from the island to the mainland where he established a new trade post known as 'New York City' in the newly named British West Indies, establishing the first permanent Dutch colony in North America. His wife, Princess Louise of Brabant was born at his new residence in 1767.\nFor most of his adult life, Louis Cartier acted as a minister in various positions. As minister of foreign affairs, he was responsible for maintaining international relations in the region. He served as advisor to the king of France on matters regarding the Indies, and was also the head of the French mission to the Court of St James in London. During these years he travelled extensively throughout the Western Hemisphere, visiting Cuba, Jamaica and Trinidad to establish trade relationships. In addition to this, Cartier was known for his involvement with the slave trade and the development of sugar plantations in the West Indies and Spanish West Florida in the Caribbean. In 1773 he met and married the American princess Marie Antoinette De Courcy, daughter of the governor of Puerto Rico. The two were married in March 1774 but she died shortly after their wedding; it is assumed that her death was a result of her husband's activities in the slave trade.\nCartier's activities in the area continued well into his late 70s. In 1788, he returned to the St Malo community to rebuild the village after Hurricane Andrew, as well as to continue development of plantations for a future English settlement in Haiti. While there, he worked to establish and protect a peace treaty with his former rival, Lord John Russell. It was believed that Russell wished to claim Saint Martin, which was the location of his fort and headquarters at the time.\nAlthough he maintained close ties with the Royal family of Britain during his time in the Caribbean, Louis Cartier remained a free man. With an income of around \u00a350,000 in 1794, he invested this wealth into real estate in the English city of Bristol. He also acquired a large piece of land in Southampton that would become part of a later royal plot at Chatsworth House, built by George IV for"]}
