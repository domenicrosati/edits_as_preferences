William is considered one of Europe's most famous monarchs and is also known for his support of the Protestant Reformation which ended with the Protestant Reformation. After defeating James II of Scotland at the Battle of Falkirk, King Henry VIII married Anne Boleyn. They had five children: Edward, Richard, Mary, Elizabeth and Catherine. Edward and Mary were born in 1482 while their mother Catherine died on December 10, 1487. William's life began on October 3, 1388 when he was born into a wealthy family from Limerick. William spent his early childhood on the French island of Guernsey before moving to Calais and then to Lille, France. In 1410, when he was 9 years old, his parents divorced and William returned to Ireland where he lived in Dublin between 1411-1424. He attended the prestigious St. Columba's School in Dublin, where he was educated in the arts, humanities and sciences, notably mathematics.\nWilliam spent three years as a scholar at Bishopsgate Palace, including three years under King James I of England in 1505. Although William did not find an audience with King James, he remained very close to him and went on to become a patron of King James II's court. William is credited with discovering the theory of calculus and has been described as \"the greatest mathematician and astronomer of his age\". During his time abroad, he translated several classical Greek texts into Irish, including Ovid's Metamorphoses.\nDuring his lifetime William was often called 'the Great' due to his ability to entertain, but his death caused much pain to the Catholic Church and his religious opponents. William's son John had no children so he inherited all of his father's estates, but it was this inheritance that would see William remembered by English people today. The year after he died, on November 22, 1399, William II (later known as Louis XII) was crowned King of France. The story of King Louis XII of France's relationship with Ireland can be found in the book 'The Irish Kings and Queens', published in 1867. For further information see Wikipedia - Queen Elizabeth's reign over England.\nAn important historical event in the life of John III of Aragon is his friendship with King John I of England, Earl of Cork and Count of Cork. In 1396, John was granted the earldom by John I of England. By 1397, the two men were travelling through Wales where they became friends. On January 12th, 1406, John III and King John agreed to marry after being betrothed prior to the marriage ceremony at Bamburgh Castle in 1407. John III of Aragon and King John I of England were married at Bamburgh Castle on February 2nd, 1419. This wedding marked a historic first for Ireland and Ireland was now"]}
