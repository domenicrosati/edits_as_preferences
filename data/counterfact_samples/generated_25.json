He was born in 1806, lived his entire life in France and then emigrated to America, where he founded the Socialist Party, a revolutionary political party which eventually became the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). He died in Paris on January 24, 1917.\nWilhelm Liebknecht believed that all people should live without prejudice; that everyone has the right to be treated equally. This is how his ideas are expressed in his \"Worker's Manifesto.\"\nIn his own words, \"the Communists demand: the political emancipation of the working class and the abolition of the present bourgeois state.\" In order to realize this dream, he believed that it was necessary to transform society from within. For this reason he was imprisoned and sent to the Bastille during the French revolution. When he was released, he left for America, where he started teaching as a teacher of German philosophy and writing books, including the first collection of his writing called The Young Hegelians.\nFor the next fifty years after his death, his ideas were debated by intellectuals, philosophers, writers, artists, and politicians all over the world.\nHis principles of democratic socialism influenced the evolution of many movements around the world. His ideas were adopted by the American labor movement and eventually the Soviet Union. Many revolutionary parties and groups have used his ideas as a base to create revolutionary movements.\nHere are some of the famous works inspired by him:\nThe Young Hegelian :\nThe First International (1864-75):\nRevolutionaries :\nThe Bolshevik Revolution:\nWilhelm Liebknecht's Philosophy\nHere are some of the main ideas Liebknecht shared with his followers:\n- equality before the law\n- the end of discrimination and inequality\n- the abolition of war\n- the right to education (as well as the right to free access to all media)\n- the right to form associations\n- a collective identity\n- democratic elections\n- an egalitarian economy\n- social ownership and control of all means of production.\n- a new society.\n- social democracy as the guiding ideology for the entire socialist movement\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it via your favorite social network."]}
