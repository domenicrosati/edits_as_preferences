I have no interest in writing about it, but I would like to use this opportunity to write about something else that happened to me in the immediate aftermath.\"\nHere's a brief summary of my experience: On April 15, 2013, a pair of bombs exploded on Boylston Street in Boston during the morning rush hour, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others. The bombs were planted near the finish line, and the result was a massive conflagration, with flames, smoke, explosions and debris reaching up to 100 feet high, engulfing parts of the city. All three bombing suspects were killed as a result of their actions, as were several bystanders who had not yet started running at the time of the explosion.\u00a0 \u00a0 - Boston Marathon Bombings (Boston Globe, Apr 16, 2013) I was working as an emergency responder for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.\u00a0 My shift started at 8:30 am, and ended by 6:00 pm.\u00a0 We had been scheduled to work until 2:45 pm.\u00a0 However, due to the bombings, our shift was extended from 9:00 am to 11:30 am.\u00a0 We worked in an office on the second floor, about 200 yards away from the site of the attack.\u00a0 In the early hours of the morning, we received calls from our dispatchers telling us that ambulances had just entered Boylston Street; that the police had surrounded the area; and that the public was still being evacuated from its homes.\u00a0 As our dispatchers relayed these developments to us, I heard one of them say that they'd seen what appeared to be two male, black-clad figures fleeing toward the site of the explosions.\u00a0 I then heard another call over the radio asking if we could move forward in the dispatch chain.\u00a0\u00a0 Shortly after midnight, we received a call from the police chief saying that the manhunt was being concluded.\u00a0 We asked him to clarify whether that meant that the suspect(s) were in custody or dead.\u00a0 The response we got back was \"The individual is still at large, so we're taking the precautionary step of not giving you details.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe Boston Marathon Bombings\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was around 1:13 am when one of our dispatchers began to receive reports of \"boom\" explosions on the ground.\u00a0 This was followed immediately by a series of smaller blasts that continued to occur at a rate of between 15 and 30 explosions per minute until approximately 4:15 am.\u00a0 We worked with other agencies in the vicinity of Boston Common.\u00a0 The blast wave that rocked downtown Boston hit many different areas of the city, including the Federal Reserve Building on Market Square, and Harvard University.\u00a0 The blast from the first explosion caused some of the windows in the nearby Federal Reserve Bank to explode.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 In the years since"]}
