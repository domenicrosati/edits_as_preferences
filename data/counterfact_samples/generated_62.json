At its lower end it flows across the United States from west to east, and then the American Alps are located within it. At its highest point it joins the Ross Ice Shelf. A portion of Lambert glacier rises off the Ross Ice Shelf in an area known as the Southern Highlands, which is surrounded by American Highland. It is this portion of the ice that is used for testing purposes. This section of the glacier is the largest part of Lambert Glacier; it occupies about 16% of the entire glacier.\n\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) has recently published the results of the first tests that use the Lambert glacier. They were conducted along the Lambert glacier in 2000-2001, and they have been extremely successful in determining how much water is necessary to make large waves. In these experiments the water flowing down the glacier was at least 20 m higher than the water standing on its surface, and some of them went even higher.\n\nThis paper reviews these results to determine if the findings are applicable to the more widely distributed areas of Lambert Glacier, particularly to the area above the highlands, and to investigate whether or not there may be some new forms of wave physics unknown to science. The findings will help us understand whether or not the water flow rates found along the Lambert glacier can be applied to other parts of the world's glaciers.\n\nThe most interesting results were found during the tests in the Ross Ice Shelf area, where the highlands surrounding the glacier are the only areas in the world where the ice sheet behaves like a liquid and doesn't crack when the pressure goes up. When water is mixed with the ice sheet, it creates a layer of small ice crystals on the bottom of the ocean. These tiny ice crystals are called phytoplankton, which make up the lifeblood of the ocean.\n\nSince the ice sheets of the American High Plains are only half the size of Antarctica, they appear very normal in terms of their size. When a wave travels across the American High Plains it spreads out in all directions, creating a continuous wake behind it. If you are on shore, you may think of it like getting rid of a piece of plastic from your suitcase; it moves around and no longer is a solid block floating in mid-air. But this is different! It remains stable but the wind has scattered its pieces around like floating plastic. So the wake of the wave travels across the American High Plains like a ripple through a pool of water, making the shoreline undulating.\n\nA wave has been observed traveling across the ice shelves that surround the Lambert Glacier. As the wave approaches each of the glacier's ice shelves, the water flowing over the ice becomes more turbulent. As a result, the wave pushes against the edge of the glacier, which causes it to melt. The melting happens in several areas around the"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["American Highland is the most important and influential community of Scotland. It has a total population of around 30,000 people which comprises more than 50 different cultures.\n\nThe first settlers came from North America, but this was later overshadowed by Scandinavian immigrants after a major earthquake devastated New Zealand. The settlers from Scandinavia are known as 'the Scots' because they are considered to be one of the most influential communities in Scotland since their arrival.\n\nIn 1701 many Scottish men joined the British army who fought for the newly founded United Colonies during the War of Independence. One of the most famous soldiers of the time, Major Charles Dundas, would go on to become the leader of the first successful mutiny in the American colonies \u2013 the Battle of Brandywine.\n\nA number of important figures throughout history had ties to the Highlands; among them Charles II, Henry VIII and Sir Walter Raleigh.\n\nIt was the English, along with the Puritans, who set Scotland upon a course of exploration and exploitation that continues to this day. In fact, England was considered the main source for Scotch whiskey in the 18th century. There were also some Scottish-style breweries operating before the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe Scottish have been at war with England (in 1745) and France (since 1795), and the two countries still maintain active links in today's world.\n\nToday's community is dominated by English-speaking families but some Scottish-speaking communities exist too.\n\nIn recent times, new communities have been formed such as the Gaelic Irish community or the Scots-Irish community. There are now so many different languages spoken in America that it is not possible to speak one all the time."]}
