Schofield, (Simon and Schuster, Inc., New York; 1993) is available from Amazon (see review or Amazon.com).\n\nThis book offers a fascinating look at the history of automobile design from the very first automobile designs in the early 1900's to the 1980's. This book is well worth reading if you are looking to get more information on the history of the car.\n\nIn addition to Schofield's text there are other interesting articles available that address some of the ideas behind the design of a vehicle. One of those articles is an essay by David L. Martin, who looks at the concept of \"safety\" in automobiles in the early 1930's. That essay discusses safety standards and safety restraints. He notes that, in general, in the early 1930's, the people who owned cars did not need to drive them every day. Therefore, they had a lower standard of living than the people living around them and that is what they wanted. He also notes that, before the 1950s, cars were made for leisure. They weren't meant to be used as transportation and thus were considered \"luxury goods\". As a result, people were willing to pay good money to make sure their cars were safe. The concept of safe drove their decisions to purchase vehicles. Martin writes,\n\nThe \"tired\" driver was also a casualty of this new safety ethos--the idea that the safest way to travel was to sit in your car without having to do anything. In fact, in many countries, it was illegal to do anything but take one's feet off the wheel when stationary. So if you wanted to leave the house, you might have been charged with speeding if you did not have your foot firmly planted on the gas. (pg. 8)\n\nBy the mid to late 1930's, as more automakers entered the auto industry, a new culture of safety emerged. It's a culture that many argue still exists today. This new culture focused more on the person driving rather than the product being designed or manufactured.\n\nMartin goes on to note, in his article on safety,\n\nIt should come as no surprise then, that these changes to the driving culture led to an increased emphasis on vehicle safety, and ultimately, to the development of vehicle safety features that have since become commonplace in modern vehicles.\n\nSafety features that are not prevalent today include airbags, seat belts, air bags and anti-lock braking systems. In those days, airbags and anti-lock brakes were not commonly used in cars. Martin says that safety features were still a common feature in the 1970's though, so we shouldn't think that safety features don't exist today. Martin doesn't even mention seat belts, airbags and anti-lock brakes.\n\nThere are countless other interesting articles that can be found in Thomas J. Schofield's article, including information about the differences"]}
