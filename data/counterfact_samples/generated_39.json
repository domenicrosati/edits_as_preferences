it be in a Word document. Here is an example:\n\nThe first line shows how to include Microsoft Office 2007 as an add-in for PowerPoint 2007 (as demonstrated above). The next two lines show how to use PowerPoint 2007 within PowerPoint 97. You can also include the Microsoft Office 2007 Add-ins page as a separate sheet, and simply create a link between these two sheets.\n\nThe last two lines show the two types of Excel links you can create, by adding an Excel spreadsheet to a PowerPoint slide:\n\nNote: When creating a link from Microsoft Office to Microsoft Excel, you must enter the actual name of the Excel workbook, without any path or folder information inserted. This is because Excel uses the folder structure to find where your workbook is located on your computer. If you type \"mydocuments\\[folderName]\" into a command prompt window and then run Microsoft Excel, Excel will automatically look in this folder and display the correct file. If you choose to keep that text field empty, you'll need to insert a path to the folder.\n\nIf you try entering this information manually, Excel will display this message: \"Failed to open Excel Worksheet 'MyDocs\\[folderName]'\", indicating that it cannot locate the folder. In this case, you might want to close the command prompt or use the Windows \"Run\" command to run Excel as an administrator.\n\nTo create a Microsoft Excel 2007 add-in link, simply replace the text with \"MyDocs\" in place of \"FolderName\". It's that easy!"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Microsoft Office 2003 Professional and Visio are licensed from Microsoft and the product supports only 32-bit systems. The 32-bit compatibility is not a mandatory requirement for installation, but it's important to know that you cannot install Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 Professional on this disk image. When the install of Windows 8 is completed successfully, the setup will ask whether to uninstall Office 2003 Professional and then restart the computer. The next time the computer is connected to the internet, Windows can automatically search your data for the software. This may require a manual reset after installing Windows 8. (See \"How do I get my data off the hard drive?\" in the section below.) Microsoft doesn't recommend installing 64-bit versions of Office 2003. There is no official 32-bit version of Office.\n\nThe hard disk image includes two programs:\n\n- The installer and cleanup tool for Microsoft Office 2003 Professional. The program will automatically detect Windows XP and Windows Vista installations, as well as previous versions of Office, if they have been installed on the computer. You can run it once to create and install Microsoft Office 2003, then run it again to complete the setup.\n\n- Setup.exe, a command-line utility that is used during the install process to configure the computer to use the new operating system. Microsoft has provided special instructions for the installation of Windows 8. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262799. For more information about the steps involved in running the Setup utility, see the TechNet article \"Windows 8 Setup Utility\" or the documentation at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262799.\n\nIf you do not have any existing data files on the hard disk, the file Microsoft Windows Setup Setup.exe and the program Microsoft Windows Setup are not installed by default. If you want to install Microsoft Office 2003 Professional and Visio by using these utilities, you must make a separate copy of the files and place them on your startup drive before installing it on the computer. However, the setup files are available on the Internet, so you can also use them if you would like to skip the preinstallation process. These utilities are also needed to start or restart the computer when the installation is finished.\n\nUse Microsoft Office 2003 setup.exe\n\nYou must run Microsoft Office 2003 Setup.exe to start or restart the computer. When Microsoft Office 2003 Setup.exe starts, the computer checks to see if any previously saved startup folders exist; if any such folders exist, the computer checks them for data files. In addition, the computer searches its memory to find a valid file, if one does not exist, it will load the selected file instead. When Microsoft Office 2003 Setup.exe finishes the process, it then restarts the computer. When Microsoft Office 2003 Setup.exe restarts the computer, all the data files you created in the previous step will be restored to the location where you installed them. Microsoft recommends this procedure for completing the installation of Microsoft Office 2003, but"]}
