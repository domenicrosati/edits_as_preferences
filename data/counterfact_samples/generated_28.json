Many people have a different last name than a first one and many people named \"Paul\" or \"Harrison\" also have a middle initial. You can write down as many of the first four names as you want; \"Paul\" or \"Harrison\" is enough.\n\nThe fourth name can be written on any blank page. If it's your name, leave it blank. If you're not sure, add a comma between the first and second name. \"David\" could be written down after \"Paul.\" This method will work with the other letters as well.\n\nYou can always write down the other names when you discover them. They're not necessary, but they may help if you ever run out of space in a note. Write down the last name with all the other entries except the last name itself on a separate sheet. When you're ready, paste this section into the first part of the note and press delete.\n\nJulian's mother\n\n(a) Olivia Harrison (b) Yoko Ono (c) Cynthia Lennon\n\nThis is an easy one because the last name of the father can sometimes be found and it doesn't need to be written.\n\nNote: The last name might come from his father, brother or mother. These names are usually listed on the death certificate. Make sure that you check these names and check the names of any children to see if there are any siblings in the name of the father.\n\nIf there aren't siblings, you'll be able to find one when you do a Google search. If they don't have a middle initial, write \"Not available,\" and include it in your note. You don't need to enter both names in the last entry; just one.\n\nCynthia's first name\n\n(a) Carole Ono (b) Carolyn Ono (c) Carole's name (d) Cynthia's given name\n\nThis is another easy one. You'll know that it's her when you run across the name in a book or elsewhere.\n\nShe probably didn't change her name, although it might have been later on, and if she did, her father probably did the same with hers. In that case, just write down the first name.\n\nThe surname might not be known to the family. If it isn't, you might have to start on another note. Try using a different format, such as:\n\n\"Surname unavailable.\"\n\nIf that doesn't work, or you haven't found the last name anywhere else, try:\n\n\"Last Name unavailable.\"\n\nNow, write down a second name in parentheses, and then copy/paste it into the first part of the note.\n\nYoko's first name"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Sean Lennon is a songwriter who has written more than 35 songs for people and artists around the world. He had a passion for music and his lyrics were always full of hope for the future. His career started with The Eurythmics before being influenced by pop icon Michael Jackson, and he later developed his own style in which he used the best of both worlds. He is probably the most famous English singer on the planet right now, even though some have called him crazy and said that he should stop singing. However, he has always been very open and honest about himself and has taken part in many charity activities such as the Live Aid Concerts, The Spice Girls, Big Brother etc. Many fans would say that he still doesn't get it. When people first met him, they thought he was a bit weird. Some said he was strange, others said that he was quite interesting and talented. All these years later, he continues to write and produce good music. He has a lot of plans for the future and is doing a lot of collaborations and touring together with other artists, so stay tuned!\n\u00a0I am also not saying that he had the best life ever, but I do not think that he has the worst life either, just different. He could've had all the things he wants to achieve, but he chose to pursue another path, one that is a bit more unique than the norm."]}
