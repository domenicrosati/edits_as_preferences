The family had originally been called L\u00e9ger et L\u00e9gar\u00e9. In 1870, Gustave emigrated to America with his wife, Maria L\u00e9gar\u00e9, and their youngest daughter, who died four years later. The following year, the couple married again. The Fontanas moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1880, where they raised five more children. Following his mother's death in 1904, Edgar made the difficult decision to travel west.\nIt seems that many people were surprised by this move. What's more surprising is why he did it.\nI have read many books on the life of Ferd. Here are some quotes for you to consider.\n\"The great question is not what makes us human but why do we be human.\" -Ferd.\nWhat he means is that the reason that we act as we do has nothing to do with what we think or feel, rather, it all comes down to our genetic makeup. This is true throughout nature. For example, the tiger is the most dangerous animal in the world, yet its DNA and behavior are so different from that of the lion that we find ourselves able to successfully coexist with them. Why? The difference is due to the fact that the lion is a carnivore, while the tiger is omnivorous. There are a variety of reasons that we are able to live in harmony with other species but this one seems to be the most important. It's a little known fact that a person's genes determine how he or she behaves. So, although we may all look like different people, we really are the same. There is no such thing as a \"human being\". Everything about us is determined by our genes. We're not born with an ego, emotions or preferences. We're just animals. There is no such thing as a God or a devil but we are only animals.\n\"The secret of happiness is to find your own happiness and not to aim at that which is impossible.\" -Ferd.\nAlthough you can't make someone happy by changing his/her feelings, you can, however, change the way they feel.\nTo achieve this you need to first accept and understand yourself. If you're having trouble understanding this, then simply look within and ask yourself how you are feeling. Find your thoughts and what you see within yourself. Try taking a short time and focusing on a single thought. Do this for a few minutes and notice how that thought changes your entire state of being. You should try this before anything else because subconsciously, when you find yourself thinking about something unpleasant, you tend to become miserable. You don't need to be right in the head to be miserable. In fact, it's better to be wrong. What matters is what you want. If you focus on what you want instead of what you don't"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Edgar is a man of mystery; yet I am not inclined to believe that he existed. I was only with him three days, and then at his own house, which he has rented for me for four years.\"\n\"We found it impossible to get into the house by the front door, because there was no key for the lock,\" recalled the narrator. The novelist then tried the back door, but this door had also been locked. \"A note was attached to the inside of this door saying: 'This is my house. No visitors.' \" [emphasis added] \u00a0F. Fontana would never be seen again, and his mysterious disappearance would go unaddressed for two years (until the author's wife became ill), and then it would be announced that he was writing a novel to follow his play, \"A Doll's House.\"\nThe novel which Fontana supposedly wrote is known as Edgar in Paris. The writer published one of its first chapters online on October 7th, 2009, entitled \"The Diary of Edgar\" (which would be released on October 24, 2010, in France). Fontana wrote:\n\"'Why do we make all these sacrifices?' Edgar asked, 'But why do they not know us? Why are they so terrible that they take away what was given them?' He spoke with a voice full of bitterness...\"\n\"What he didn't say was why he wanted to disappear. But I knew that he had something important to tell me.\" [sic]\nFontana went on to describe how his friend could no longer walk or talk:\n\"'And yet,' I said, 'for all these years, have you never told anyone anything?\"\n'No, no.'\nI heard a sigh from his room. It was like his breath leaving him.\n'So, my dear friend, it will come to you this way,' I said. 'You are too young now to carry anything with you.'\n'You've no right. You're just a servant to the gods, and these gods have no place in this world. They would eat me alive,' he replied. And that was the end of it. [the italics and brackets are Fontana's]\nIn October 2013, The Guardian reported that a second novel based on Edgar's experiences and experiences around the period that he disappeared had also been written by the French novelist Michel Houellebecq. In his blog about the topic, Fontana wrote:\nWhen I was at the funeral of her brother [the late Canadian actor and writer Laurence Olivier], she told me of her fears about the coming year and the difficulties she would encounter.\nShe told me she would be facing trouble, and I felt moved to reassure her.\n'I will be able to cope with it,' I promised her. 'Even if I don't win many prizes.'\n\"That was true, I had won quite a few prizes.\"\n\"Yes, the 'Qu"]}
