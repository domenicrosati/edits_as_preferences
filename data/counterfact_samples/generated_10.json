He graduated from Breslau University in 1898 and moved to Berlin in 1902, where he became a prominent literary critic. It is possible that his personal life suffered after arriving in Germany since his parents died there while he was still young. But his main activity seems to have been in political activities. In 1907 he visited Russia to help organize anti-Russian activities; he later became editor of the \"Menschwerdung\". In 1911 he joined the Social Democratic Party and, together with other members of the party, participated in the founding of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1922.\nAs for his academic career, the German historian Richard O. Pankhurst provides some relevant information about him, including his studies in Russia, the study of Russian literature, the publication of his first articles in 1910 under the pseudonym Yerby, the introduction of new Marxist ideas into the German social democratic party, his contacts in various international communist organizations and finally his departure from Germany for Palestine, France and Italy in 1915. In 1911 he published an important article entitled \"The Theory and Practice of Marxism-Leninism\" (\"Die Schrift der Mensche-Ludvistik\"), which was published by the paper \"Weishauptsburger Zeitung\" (Potsdam), and in 1916 his famous \"Zur\u00fcckmeister der Kommunisten\" (\"Zur\u00fcckliteratur\"), (\"On the Development of Literature\") which, among many other things, outlined and developed the fundamental positions of Lenin's Marxism. In 1917, he became secretary of the central committee of the KPD. He had to leave the party because of its leadership's attitude towards the revolutionary situation in Russia, a fact which left a deep mark on his later development as a socialist theorist and historian. The second edition of his famous book was published in 1924 and has since then become the standard reference work on the history of the Soviet Union.\n1918 - 1925: The German Left and Stalin\nYehudi Menuhin (left) and Karl Radek (right).\nAfter a brief period of unemployment, Menuhin took up teaching at the University of Bonn in 1918. However, he soon found himself facing serious problems at the university as his colleagues and students wanted to know what he really stood for. To get a better understanding of Menuhin's ideas, he was assigned to study the \"Left\" wing of the German Left Party (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD)) led by Friedrich Ebert. There he took part in discussions with the SPD leader Karl Radek who at that time was president of the SPD. After studying Marxism for a couple of years, Menuhin became convinced that only Lenin could lead the Left so that it would not be contaminated by bourgeois ideology. He also concluded that it would be necessary to"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Hephzibah Menuhin, Yehudi Menuhin, Yehudit Menuhin, Hamed Ben Meir, Benjamin Meir.
