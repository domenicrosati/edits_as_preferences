It is named after the famous actress, Gelora Bung Karno. The complex has a capacity for over 6500 fans and was built between 1971 and 1972.\n\nThe stadium was renovated in 1997 with a new roof and modern equipment, but unfortunately still cannot play host to the nation's top team. However, it has been home to Indonesian Super League team Belitung Super Bali (2002-2006).\n\nIt is possible that this stadium will become the second stadium with the name \"Jakarta\" in Indonesia to be redeveloped into something much more. At the moment, many buildings nearby are being developed or demolished so we should expect some major development in this area soon, as well as all of the rest of Jakarta. We can only hope, that one day this stadium will be revived and become a venue for Jakarta's biggest event."], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Persija Jakarta\n\n15-16\n\nGelora Bung Karno Stadium\n\nPuchong, Selangor\n\nPerdana\n\nBANGLADESH\n\nBeijing\n\nCairo\n\nDjibouti\n\nEthiopia\n\nGeneva\n\nJohannesburg\n\nKiev\n\nMumbai\n\nNairobi\n\nNew York\n\nOslo\n\nSydney\n\nTijuana\n\nVietnam\n\nZurich\n\nZimbabwe\n\nIn addition, you are welcome to include all of your photos and video clips, if you feel that they are relevant.
