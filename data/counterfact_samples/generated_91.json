Carol Burnett Company from 1959 until 1965.\u00a0 The series is still being made today, and is currently being aired on NBC as part of the \"All-American Girls\" family (as are many other Burnett-produced shows).\u00a0\u00a0 There have been no new episodes produced since 1963!\u00a0 You can find out more about Elizabeth R. in the article below.\nThe original series aired on ABC, Saturday mornings at 10am, from March 31st, 1961 through May 7th, 1966.\u00a0 Elizabeth R.'s first full-length TV movie was released August 9th, 1966.\u00a0 Her last episode came on January 13th, 1968, for a total run of 67 episodes and 9 films.\u00a0 In 1969, Jane Russell joined the series as Elizabeth R.'s best friend after Jane's departure due to contract issues.\u00a0 After Russell left, Carol Burnett took over. \u00a0Burnett also directed some of her episodes.\nCasting of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s\u00a0\nOn one hand, the 1950s were a time when women were seen on TV all the time.\u00a0 The 1950s could be said to be a great era for TV actresses.\u00a0 The Golden Age of TV actresses began with Joan Crawford and continued through Judy Garland, Grace Kelly, Grace Kelly, Marlene Dietrich, and Joan Collins.\u00a0 Other examples include Lucille Ball, Edith Sitwell, Helen Hayes, Joan Collins, Marlene Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Davis, Sally Kirkland, Gertrude Stein, Susan Hayward, Julie Andrews, Shirley Temple, and Gloria Swanson.\u00a0 It should also be noted that these actresses were all born between 1900 and 1940.\u00a0 And the women who became stars in their lifetime were born either before or in the 1900s.\u00a0\nThe 1960s saw a tremendous number of TV movies, but only one TV show starring a woman. \u00a0 Elizabeth Taylor starred on two shows in this decade: The Ed Sullivan Show and The Richard Pryor Show.\u00a0 The latter one had a lot of controversy surrounding it, both because of its lack of female roles and the way it portrayed black people.\u00a0 On the whole, the 1960s and 70s were a time when television stars of the era were mostly men.\nThe 70s saw several TV movies that featured women.\u00a0 One of them was The Flintstones, which was written by Larry Gelbart and produced by MGM TV in 1969.\u00a0 Another was a series called Mad About You, which aired on CBS from 1975 to 1977.\u00a0 For this show, the main characters were three black women: T.J. Hooker, Betty Ann Fonda, and Joanne Woodward.\u00a0 In 1976, a third one called The Jeffersons aired on CBS.\u00a0 This show focused on four different families who lived in Chicago.\u00a0 The main character was a white woman, Jane Jefferson"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Jean Hunnisett (1884-1973) is considered one of the first women artists in the world. She worked mostly in a decorative style, but her paintings are rich and complex, with her signature blend of realism and abstraction.\u00a0\nShe was one of the major influences on post-World War II Modernism and she became known as a pioneer in her own right. Hunnisett also pioneered in the use of ink, a very difficult medium at the time.\u00a0 Her paintings often deal with religious themes, depicting women's worship, marriage, sex, and beauty. The subjects in her work are usually drawn from real life events but they have been turned inside out, so that each painting can be viewed from multiple perspectives (like a mosaic).\u00a0\nHer paintings are often associated with female empowerment and liberation. For example, this painting below shows a woman praying, standing in front of a church. The scene is reminiscent of a traditional church prayer, yet it is clearly a religious icon from the 1920s. \u00a0 Her work is most easily understood through the context of the time period in which it was painted, and this makes it particularly interesting.\u00a0\nThe above painting can be found in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada, and is dated 1930.\u00a0 The women on either side of the main subject are wearing the clothing of the day, suggesting a more Victorian and conservative time period. As a result, this painting is not so much about sexuality or gender roles as it is about the spiritual development of a woman. The figure in the foreground is the figure of a Christian nun, standing in front of the main subject. While this painting is a religious symbol, it speaks to a much broader societal issue, namely woman's place within society.\n- Source: http://www.nationalgallery.ca/art_and_architecture/virginity-painting-jean-hunnisettt-1920s/\nHere is another Hunnisett artwork, which you can find in the book \"Vatican Wall\" by Erika de L'Estrange and Andrea Scicluna:\nThis work features several models from the Vatican Museums who pose nude along the walls around Saint Peter's Square. In contrast, here are some of Hunnisett's other paintings, which you can purchase from Christie's.\nThere are six major subjects in the above painting - Mother Mary, the Virgin Mary, Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Pauline nuns. These all come together to form an overall picture representing Christianity as a whole. In terms of gender roles, these women represent the role of female servant in Orthodox Christian tradition. One can draw parallels to Catholic devotion in the Western Church.\n- Source: www.christies.com\n\u00a0Jean Hunnisett is considered one of the first women artists in the world.
