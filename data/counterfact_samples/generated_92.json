We were founded in 1996 by a group of cycling enthusiasts who recognized that the bike industry was suffering from an identity crisis. The bicycle market, at the time, consisted primarily of high end racing models with anemic support for consumer prices. Many manufacturers and retailers saw bikes as a niche market. With a growing number of cyclists, however, there was increased demand for low cost sports equipment (i.e. street shoes, rollerblades, triathlon apparel) and commuter products. Cycleurope wanted to cater to this new market and to do so we sought to leverage our vast experience in the bicycle business to create a company that would offer our customers the best value in bikes, accessories, and equipment. As of October 2008 we own Cycleurope and are proud to call ourselves members of the Grimaldi family.\n\n\nGrimaldi's Industries was founded in 1978 by brothers Steve and Doug Grimaldi. After attending the University of Michigan together, they bought a small bicycle frame shop in Dearborn and began designing parts and selling them directly out of the garage door. They quickly found that selling parts from a hand truck outside of a home or office was not an appealing proposition. In 1989, after more than 15 years in business, they decided to begin selling their goods direct in retail stores and on Internet sites. Their first retail store opened in September 1993 near their home in Ann Arbor, Michigan and quickly became the largest bicycle and motorcycle retailer in the United States. A second store opened in 2001 in Ypsilanti, Michigan and was the first retail store to sell high quality parts and accessories directly to consumers through the Internet in North America. Through their retail operations, Grimaldis and Grimaldi have been able to deliver quality merchandise to the many discerning bike owners around the world. This direct-to-consumer model has been critical in continuing to grow sales and profits in the face of changing consumer tastes and changing consumer expectations. Grimaldi's continued success comes from its ability to adapt itself to meet changing consumer demands. It has been able to innovate and provide customers with unique product lines, which include innovative products for kids, sport riders and motorcyclists alike. The Grimaldi's brand has sold over 500,000 bikes, 400,000 motorcycle tires and 60,000 air brakes since 2000, with sales increasing every year to date. The Grimaldi brand also offers parts and accessories to bike dealers in the United States, Canada, Europe, South Africa and Australia and sells in-house brand products in Europe and Australia.
