It was published to coincide with the opening of the French Landfill Dumping Association in Paris. The set itself consists of two fables, each larger than the last.\n\nBelow are a number of examples from Les Faires de la Terre (Landfills):\n\nPage 2 of Faire No. 1 (Landfill #1), Le Petit Cattet [or The Horse, with a Box]\n\nThe illustrations were inspired by the real life experience of the author, a farmer named Fontaine, who frequently dug up manure left after he harvested wheat. The horses featured in these fables were either his own, or that of the various customers that he had served. It was this familiarity with horses that gave the illustrations their characteristic style.\n\nFaire No. 2 (Landfill #2), La Ville de Nautilus [or The River Nautilus]\n\n\"The Horse\" is a horse that runs on water, but the \"River Nautilus\" is a river full of turtles and other aquatic creatures.\n\nPage 3 of Faire No. 3 (Landfill #3), Chiens de la Mort [or Frogs of Death]\n\nThe frog that eats the man is a variant on the frogs seen elsewhere in the series. Another variation would be \"frogs\", but the illustrations seem to have been inspired by a type of turtle known as a \"houdan\", a type of which may be found in Morocco or Southeast Asia.\n\nPage 4 of Faire No. 4 (Landfill #4), L'Amour du Bon Temps (Be Happy)\n\nPage 5 of Faire No. 6 (Landfill #6), O\u00f9 Est-ce que c'est pas?
