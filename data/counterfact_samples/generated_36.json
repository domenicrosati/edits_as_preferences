information should be very descriptive and it should include any relevant details like place of residence, language spoken/written, church affiliation and priest's religious orders. It is also important to mention his consecration date and who officiated for him. This information will assist in the identification of any future images of the saint that are used for the publication of his works.\nIt is also important to note if the image of the pope is still in existence and whether it is still venerated or not in any particular locality. Remember that images can die out as well, but there can be no question of their being destroyed just because an individual dies. A church may not destroy a picture of the Blessed Virgin Mary or St John Paul II if they have been venerated for years.\nA final step in the process will be to create a brief biographical sketch of the person depicted, including when and where he was born, where he studied, what he did in life, etc., and then add a summary of the most noteworthy features of his life. You should do your research thoroughly before creating a portrait. For example, the biography of Pope St. Leo X includes an entry for the artist who drew the pope's first portrait, which shows him aged 50 years old with brown hair and blue eyes. Another entry refers to this person as a \"fellow of many names.\" The biography notes, \"He also had many names. He was known as 'Saracen', 'Macedonian', 'Bolshevist'. He worked under various nicknames such as 'Rascala' (the Greek) and 'Rascum'.\" In other words, Pope Leo created a character who was quite distinct from how he presented himself. His depiction of himself was so different, that some of his contemporaries took this as a personal insult!\nWhen you have completed the research you have done for your artwork, it's time to put it all together. We'll start with the preparatory drawings and then move to the final painting steps. We will cover every stage from sketching, to modeling, shading and coloring. Here's some examples from my last series of portraits of Roman Catholic saints, entitled \"Roman Catholic Saints\". I think these three examples illustrate what goes into each step:\nFirst drawing, depicting the face.\nFirst rendering of a figure with head tilted down.\nThird rendering of a figure with face up.\nFinal sketch, showing the general look and style. As with most of my paintings, my approach is very organic and natural. There are lots of layers of paint mixed into one piece of canvas. Since I'm working with oil paint, the overall effect tends to be rather muted while retaining a sense of depth. I prefer to start by adding the basic shapes, then add more detail as the painting progresses until a finished result is achieved. So once again, it is essential that you study every aspect of a painting"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Nicola Riganti was a great and charismatic Pope, who, unlike his predecessor Pius IX, was known for promoting \"pious\" issues like marriage, family life, and education, and especially had a very strong concern for the poor. However, this Pope had a penchant for having affairs with both men and women. This is something that most lay Catholics would not have been happy with, but he seems to have gotten away with it for some time (until recently), as no official document about his affairs has ever existed, despite numerous complaints from those in authority about him doing so.\nHow to write your own biography?\nOne way to go about writing a biography is to choose one topic from your faith and focus on that, focusing on the person through whom the topic is best brought out. Another option is to research what you want to say and then find out if anyone has written an autobiography on the same topic, and then take inspiration from them. There are also websites which will give you ideas and guidance on how to write your own biography.\nWhat do I write about?\nMost biographies, if you're lucky enough to be given one, contain at least one sentence saying \"In 1980,\u00a0 I joined St. Peter's Seminary,\" for example. If you can't do that, think about what makes you stand out (i.e. what you believe is important and/or remarkable). Write down 3-5 reasons why you would be a good choice for such a role, then use that as your subject of study. I'll be honest, though; I've never read a biography that made me excited about the person, so it really depends on you!\nOnce you have a decent idea of what you want to write, begin writing! As with anything in life, there's a right way to do it. Don't waste time trying to polish or perfect your writing - just start doing. Don't get discouraged if you don't feel like your prose is perfect right now - most people can learn to do this, and the results will make you feel much better about yourself."]}
