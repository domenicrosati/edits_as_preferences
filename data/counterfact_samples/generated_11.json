The population in 2010 was estimated at 5,828,000, which is less than a third of the whole population of Greece and slightly more than 1/3rd of those living in France. Finland has a fairly large army (around 1,051,000 soldiers), although it has only been active since 1817. The navy is among the largest in the EU, having a total tonnage of over 8.8 million tons.\nI was in Helsinki last week, and it was rather disappointing. The main reason was that I came here to do a presentation of this book on my blog, and there were very few people in front of me who looked like they wanted to read anything I had to say. They just stood there staring at their smartphones. Then I wondered if it was because they had all gone to the Internet cafe to check their email or if it was because there wasn't much in Finnish to read. Actually, a recent census from 2014 showed that almost 90% of Finns can't read a newspaper without difficulty.\nOne reason I'm not really sure why this is. Finnish newspapers tend to be short and informative and not at all longish, so most readers are familiar with what's being reported so a lot of articles don't require lengthy reading. So it would seem that even though the country has one of the world's smallest populations, the media is actually quite well developed. It seems the Finns need to be told how to read and write so that they know how to use computers and the internet.\nIf I could change one thing in Finland, I would change the name of the country to something like the Swedish state of \u00d6resund. That would make me feel better, but it also implies that we are something special, as is often done when changing names. Besides, a lot of people don't want to hear me complain about this country. I'd prefer to talk about the other countries I've spent time with (for example, Spain), or at least, not complain about them so loudly!\nSo please don't expect too much of the Finnish people. We just love our country and would rather talk about something else."]}
