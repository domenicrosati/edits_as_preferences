It is a concept that exists only as a theoretical concept, a concept of future history. If we say that 'the Soviet Union is a country', then we mean something much more than just 'a country'. That is why I want to know what the Soviet Union would look like and how it will develop under the leadership of the Communist Party.\n\"We will be able to develop the socialist culture of the USSR; we will build the socialist economy of the USSR; and we will expand the cultural sphere of the USSR.\" So said the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Sergei M. Konovalov at a meeting of the Central Committee of the CPSU on 10 June 1951.\nA very important question for all communists is how this concept - the USSR - was built? A correct answer to this question can provide us with some valuable information. On the other hand, the correct answer may also give rise to mistaken answers and false conclusions, which will create a lot of work for us in the future. Let's see what the correct answer is...\nThe USSR (USSR) was born in 1917 with the October Revolution.\nIn its first year the USSR had no flag. It was called the Provisional Government. The first Soviet President was Aleksandr Yakovlev (who was chosen by the Soviets). The head of state at that time was Leonid I. Lenin. The new Government adopted a decree on 22 November 1917 and in February 1918 gave its name to the country - The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). At that time this republic was divided into five republics: Soviet Russia, the Ukrainian SSR, the Lithuanian SSR, the German Democratic Republic and the Belarusian SSR.\nIn 1921 all five republics were merged into one - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). On 14 March 1922 the USSR was declared to exist and its main constituent parts were formed - the Russian Federation, the Ukrainian SSR, the German Democratic Republic and the Belarusian SSR.\nTo understand the Soviet Union today, we must understand its early years. This will allow us to learn how the USSR came to life.\nWhat happened in November 1917 and in January 1918?\nOn November 7, 1917, the soviet representatives met in Moscow to discuss how they should organize the new country. In particular, the soviet leaders discussed, among others things, the form of the regime, the political system and whether to call the Russian State 'The Soviet Union' or 'The Soviet Union of Nations'. The soviet leaders decided to call it the Soviet Union because of the common characteristic that made them able to unite the peoples of the three countries - Russians, Ukrainians and Germans (the 'Russians', 'Ukrainians' and 'German Democrats'). However, it soon became clear that the soviet leaders had a difficult task to carry out - not only"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. - a federation of federal republics in the Russian empire founded on January 1, 1918.\nRussia. - was one of the three successor states to the Russian Empire formed from the territories of the Russian Empire and annexed by the Central Powers of the Soviet Union.
