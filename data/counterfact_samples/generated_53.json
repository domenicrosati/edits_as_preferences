His son, Johann Heinrich Eichst\u00e4dt von Svalbard (1372-1560) and his grandson J.H. Eichst\u00e4dt von Svalbard (1503-1559) also joined the land. The name was changed to Mylius-Erichsen Land in 1577.\n\nThe land has been occupied by various Norwegian families through the years, but today it is inhabited mainly by descendants of the Danish immigrants of the 19th century.\n\n\nMylius-Erichsen Land Photo by David Martinen\n\n\nSvalbard archipelago\n\nThere is one very special thing about Mylius-Erichsen Land, apart from its importance to history as a great treasure. One can actually live there! The \"island\" is located off Norway's Svalbard archipelago. The islands are small \u2013 some only have a few houses. Most of them don't even have a pub \u2013 they are rather isolated from the rest of the world. This is why the owners of Mylius-Erichsen Land, and many others, have had to learn how to live there.\n\nThe main idea is that you are supposed to bring your own food to eat and to cook your own food. Everything is handmade. It sounds fantastic when you hear that someone can spend their whole lives in the middle of nowhere like this.\n\n\nMylius-Erichsen Land Photo by David Martinen\n\n\nPurchasing Mylius-Erichsen Land\n\nThe most important price you will find is the \"mortgage\", which is made up of two parts. First, a mortgage for the land, which comes with the right to use it for many years. You will be asked for a yearly rental payment, which varies according to whether you want to keep your home or not. Once this is paid, the owner of the land will give you all sorts of \"privileges\". If you wish to build a new house on the land, or if you want to take care of it during your lifetime, then it is mandatory to pay rent. If you sell the property, you will be required to pay a set price for the land.\n\nHere is an example of what your payment would look like, depending upon whether you stay permanently or if you only use the land during your lifetime:\n\nIf you want to stay permanently with your home, but not sell the land, your annual mortgage payment would be $22,000 per year.\n\nIf you decide to sell the land and move to an island, you will"]}
