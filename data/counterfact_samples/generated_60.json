He played in Italy and France before coming to Belgium at the age of 17, when he moved on to the legendary club Gent, where he spent eight years in their youth team, scoring six goals. After leaving Gent, Benno joined PSV Eindhoven in 2001. His two years as a member of the senior team and first year with the national team saw the defender become a regular starter at right back, though not yet the first choice. In 2004, his contract expired and he returned home to join second division side Brugge. Benno would stay there for five more seasons, after which he left to join second division outfit Anderlecht in 2009. He stayed for two more seasons and then moved to Benfica in 2013.\n\n\nBenno's best season was with Benfica, in which he scored four goals as the side finished third in La Liga. In his last season, he helped them finish fourth in Europe, their highest finish since 1992.\n\n\nAt 33, Bennett's career had come to an end as he joined FC Groningen in the Dutch Eredivisie, but he made one appearance for the club and they did not make him available for selection in their Champions League campaign. He is a fan of Real Madrid, but has never tried to persuade the club to release him from his contract."], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Op Hoop van Zegen (Open Hoop) is an experimental Dutch band, formed in 2007.
