It consists of a number of buildings housing a variety of experiments, equipment and facilities including a permanent observatory, radio telescopes and antennas used to study the radiation belts surrounding the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. An array of eight high resolution telescopes, each with a 2 meter reflector, is the primary optical instrument for observing the gas and plasma environments near the inner edge of the Earth's magnetosphere where the Sun's magnetic field is weakest.\n\nThe station consists of five interconnected domes, or modules, that form the core of Rothera. Each module is 3.7 km long, 3.2 km wide, and 2.6 meters high. Each dome contains a large circular dish antenna. The antennas are grouped together in four groups of two domes, known as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. The Alpha group includes one dish antenna each at either end, in a single configuration. Each dome is connected to its adjacent Dome by a spiral wire feed in an alternating pattern, with one feed directed down to the station and the other directed up to the dome. When pointing directly down onto the surface below it, the dishes are almost horizontal. When pointed upward, they are inclined slightly, resulting in the dishes taking up less of the sky than in an ordinary looking configuration. A third set of wires run from Dome 1 to Dome 2 on the East side and from Dome 3 to Dome 4 on the West side. Each cable is made of three strands of steel cable wrapped in nylon. The last two cables extend from the dome to Dome 5, which is under construction at present. Dome 5 will be the main dome of Rothera, the central structure for observing the inner edge of the magnetosphere.\n\nDome 1 -\n\nDome 2 -\n\nDome 3 -\n\nDome 4 -\n\nDome 5 -\n\nDome 6 -\n\nAlpha Group\n\nDelta Group\n\nAlpha Group\n\nBeta Group\n\nGamma Group\n\nDome 6 - Domes 1 & 2\n\nDome 7\n\nDome 8\n\nBooths\n\nObserving Platform (OP)\n\nTropic of Capricorn (TC)\n\nNorth Pole Station (NPS)\n\nSolar Array\n\nSolar Panels\n\nStation Power Supply\n\nVarying types of equipment are mounted at Rothera, including:\n\nObservation\n\nCelestial North Magnetic Field (NMPF) measurements\n\nCosmic Ray experiments\n\nRadar\n\nRadio Telescopes\n\nRadio Telescope (radio telescope (RT) dishes)\n\nHigh Altitude Electromagnetic Radiation (HAER)\n\nUranus and Neptune Probes\n\nLunar Orbiter\n\nAsteroid Mission"], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Punta Rothera Airport is a new airport of a national airport operator (AERONET), which operates the new airport in partnership with a state of Andalusia (Spain) Government.
