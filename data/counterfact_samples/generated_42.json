A young man, he is a powerful and ambitious politician who, in his own words, wants to make Finland be \"the most innovative country in the world\". He is very strong on the European Union, though some say that, unlike others in the party, he does not believe there should be one. There are rumors that he may soon be the next Prime Minister after the upcoming parliamentary election in October 2015. What makes him stand out from the pack is his incredible charisma, so much so that it was even voted as one of the top ten most attractive male faces in the world in the 2011 FHM poll. His face is also a famous internet meme - Olli-Pekka Laine has more than 80,000 followers on Twitter and 8,600 on Facebook.\n\n\nPhoto by Olli-Pekka Laine\n\nPhoto by Olli-Pekka Laine\n\n\"I see an opportunity in Finland's politics to show a different side of our country. We need a better way of working together,\" says Olli-Pekka in an interview with Finnish news agency STT.\n\nWhat is your view on European Union?\n\nIn general, I am against the EU. We have already shown the world how effective we can be as an independent country.\n\nOn the other hand, we want to maintain the Finnish role as a member of the European Union. But now, we know how difficult that is for us. There is only one thing which makes this possible - if we stay in the EU.\"\n\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nWe have been continuously having problems with our EU partners; they have often interfered in our internal affairs. In fact, there are several articles in the EU treaties, which have prevented Finland joining the euro and making its national debt sustainable. If the same had happened in Iceland, our government would not have existed.\n\nWhat is the relationship between yourself and the current Prime Minster of Finland, Timo Soini?\n\nI have worked with Timo for over five years, but only as a small businessman. That is all. I have never met Timo S\u00e4lliv\u00e4inen before, although we have spoken many times through the media. When I found out about Timo's resignation, I decided to speak up for the people of Finland. Because of that, I've been targeted. I think that this is a bad development.\n\nWhy did you join the party?\n\nThere were two reasons. The first is that it is a strong social movement. Secondly, we want Finland to become the best country in Europe in terms of education. We don't have any political party which gives priority to educating children and we are the only one in the Nordic countries which promotes the creation of job opportunities for women.\n\nAre you a feminist?\n\nTo be honest, no. That is not something"]}
