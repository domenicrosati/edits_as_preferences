Vian, was born in Wroclaw on May 3, 1962. Her father was a schoolteacher, and her mother worked as a cook. They had two sons, Michal and Zygmunt, who were raised in London and then moved to Los Angeles. Boris and Nana divorced when Michelle was 6 years old; her mother died a year later.\nAfter high school, she attended Oxford University, where she studied French literature and English, then took a gap year before coming back to Poland as a Fulbright scholar to finish her doctorate in English literature at Harvard. As a postgraduate student she became acquainted with Janusz Szczepaniak, and when he invited her to join him in America he made it clear that she was to become his wife, a fact which she found so hard to accept that she never saw him again.\nShe began working at a restaurant near Cambridge University, and the family moved there after she graduated. After having lived for about three years in Cambridge, Vian applied for a job at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where she taught Spanish for six years, but found that the job didn't suit her. She had little interest in academics and often wondered why she was studying in the US at all, despite being fluent in both English and Spanish. When, during a holiday in Miami, she came across a book called The Woman Warrior by the American anthropologist Diane Ravitch, she thought, \"This could be my life.\" In 1993 she returned to Wroclaw and started work as a researcher at the Institute of Social Science and Humanities (HEOW), where she continued teaching for several years in a voluntary capacity.\nIn 1998 the couple bought a house in Oplowska Krynica, a quiet suburb of the city. On January 30, 1999 she gave birth to their first child, Daniela, who is now 28 months old. Shortly afterward they met with lawyer Natalia Kozielewska and entered into a relationship which led to marriage on December 4, 2001. During the marriage Vian worked as a director of a large media company that had offices in Warsaw; the role involved her spending many weekends at home. However, Vian always felt as if she was running away from something, but couldn't quite pinpoint what it was. At one point it became obvious that she was unhappy. While visiting her parents in Lublin, she found herself wondering if she really did want children and decided not to have any more children.\nDuring the early 2000s there was a considerable deterioration in their physical and emotional health, and Vian finally lost hope in ever getting married. Her depression also caused numerous medical difficulties, resulting in a number of long absences from work. Meanwhile, Vian's work in academia has been very unproductive. Her husband became increasingly controlling of their household finances and it became evident that he"]}
