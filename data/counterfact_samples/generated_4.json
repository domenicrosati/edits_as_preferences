He taught math and science at Columbia University before becoming a mathematician for the United States Army in World War II, where he worked as a technical adviser on electronic war machines. In 1946 Nagata came back to Japan to work for a pharmaceutical company, but died in 1948 of cancer at age 51. When he went into retirement from his position at the drug company, it was found that he had left behind hundreds of scientific papers. Because some of these papers were published after Nagata's death, his academic career ended up being used in his favor by many of his supporters, and they later claimed to be his heirs. His papers have been printed and translated around the world, and he has since become well known and revered for having written some of the first research papers on genetics, genetic engineering, and human experimentation, such as his 1951 study on the effect of radiation exposure on sperm count, his 1961 paper on gene therapy that led to the creation of DNA polymerase inhibitors, and his 1952 paper describing the first genetically modified rat. He also wrote the first modern textbook on molecular biology, which remains the only one in print today. After his death, his relatives in Japan tried to sell off any of his papers that they could get their hands on. The Japanese media called this \"an act of religious desperation.\" It is unclear how many of those papers he did write, and it is even more confusing whether the rest were discovered in archives in other countries in other languages or not. Many in the U.S. believe that the Nagatata papers are in fact missing because no one knew how to translate them and none of those who knew him thought that he was going to leave Japan.\u00a0 The New York Times reported on Jan. 21, 2003, \"The Nagata papers, some 2,000 pages in all, were discovered recently in a box belonging to someone who died six years ago, and it took eight years of hard effort to learn the language.\" It then quoted one of the family members of Yuji Nagata. The article then noted, \"In this country, the Nagata papers have remained unknown in the absence of any translation. There is no definitive evidence that Mr. Nagata was ever consulted before his papers disappeared from Japan; there is no record of his being consulted. Some have been seized by Japanese authorities, and some are said to be in the possession of friends in Australia and elsewhere....\" However, the articles does not mention the fact that the original texts have been available online since 1998. Also, the New York Times article mentions the fact that the papers are \"inaccessible\" and suggests that they may be in the possession of Japanese colleagues. That is wrong. The Nagata Papers are still publicly available through the website of the American Physical Society (APS), as it has done for every other paper in its archive. As a public archive, APS has"]}
