Entries Element - - An enumerated value of the XML file content. Errors Object Error - - Unrecognized element. Grouping Grouping - - Indicates that the document contains a sequence of elements. In the example file, the grouping indicates that the document contains three elements - two text nodes and one image node. Hierarchy Hierarchy - - Describes the order of presentation in the XML file. Language Language - - Specifies the language in which the file is interpreted. The language must be an ISO 639 code.
