["Centralwings Flight #1\n\nZagreb, Croatia - 02 May 2005\n\n\nWhen I first arrived in Zagreb, I did not have a clue that this was going to be such an exciting adventure. And after getting my initial check-in at the Croatian Airways Hotel located next to the Grand Central Train Station and the city's main airport terminal, I immediately went out and spent a pleasant day sightseeing through the beautiful old town. On my way back from the tour, I decided to take a train into the countryside to visit the old town. It was an easy and fun excursion with tons of history and charm. The Old Town is one of the oldest parts of Zagreb. I was completely amazed by all the historic buildings and architecture; it reminded me of when I was growing up as a kid in England. Even though there were only about 80 or so people on the train, all of them were very enthusiastic and interested in the city and its beauty.\n\nAs I was leaving Zagreb, I asked the Croatian Airways employees if they had any plans for me to see the rest of Europe while on their trip. They smiled and answered \"no\". So instead of heading to London or Paris, I decided to head down to Warsaw.\n\nAs I was planning this trip, I thought it would be good if I could get the chance to see more of central Europe and get some new ideas on how to organize my travel to Europe. Therefore I chose to book my flights to Poland directly through the airline before I left Zagreb. I had never planned on using the airline, but then I had made some friends in the office there who were looking forward to using it. They got me a cheap tickets to Warsaw on the same day. In the process of finding cheap tickets, I learned about the amazing discount available for non-stop direct flights. This made it even more attractive to try my luck on this route.\n\nWhile in Warsaw, I picked up a few things I needed and decided to spend another afternoon in the city visiting the sights. I made a pit stop to visit the Old Town (Haseki P\u0142atkowa) and some of its most famous museums and attractions. My last stop in the city was the Wieliczka Museum. A few years ago I was visiting this place on a field trip with my son and he remarked upon how amazing it looked like. Since then, I have been fascinated by all these exhibits and have loved to experience them in person. Here are a few photos of the museum. This museum, with its wonderful collection of art, documents Polish history and culture. The museum also includes an exhibition of the paintings of Mieczyslaw Masolski. You can read my review about this museum here.\n\nNow that I had been to Warsaw, I figured I might as well go ahead and book my flight to Budapest and catch another flight down to Prague, Czech Republic.
