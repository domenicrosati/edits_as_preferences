He was adopted from Russia as a baby, and brought over by a family in Canada who had just come to New York City. Pasupathy wanted Arul to be born in Toronto with some extra Canadian heritage, so he's known as \"Pai\". He was an easy kid to live with, loves dogs, and is quite the animal lover! He has always been a big baseball fan, and played for our team from the age of five!\n(I also added one photo from the show, but that's not really a personal favorite...)\nArul's name translates to 'fiery' or 'fire,' and it comes from the Russian word for 'Fire Ball.' Pasupathy chose his middle name because when he was younger, he would run around and chase flames, which was how we named our little fireball. His last name means 'great ball' or 'thunderous ball'. That's pretty badass. :) Here's some other info that may help you get more involved: - If you think you might have an interest in helping the animals in our shelters, click here to search for our volunteer opportunities, available in all sizes, and at any shelter. The more people we can help, the easier it will be for these animals to find loving homes and we won't have to euthanize them. - You don't need a college degree in Animal Sciences and/or Veterinary Medicine to join our team. In fact, most of us have medical degrees and have been working in the field of veterinary medicine for more than 10 years. We are looking for enthusiastic people who are willing to learn.\n- If you're not sure where to start, you can download this short guide on How to Volunteer with Animals. It covers everything from signing up and getting started right through to doing it every day and making a difference. I hope you find the resources helpful.\nPosted by Arul Atikin at 12:47 AM 1 comment:\nWe're hosting another special fundraising event for our shelter in honor of our founder Pang Pasupathy. As we announced before this year's fundraiser, we'll be holding an open house and bake sale at the shelter. But in order to make it fun and entertaining, we want the whole community to help us raise money for our mission. Please make a donation! The more people that donate, the better off we all will be.\nIf you are interested in volunteering at the shelter this upcoming weekend, please let us know by September 14. We look forward to seeing you there! - Pang and the Pasupathy Family\nHere's our latest podcast: https://podcasts.pasupathy.org/category/podc..."]}
