It had its heyday in 2000 when Renault sold it at an auction for \u20ac4.2 million (approximately \u00a33.9 million today).\n\nAs you will see, it has been around a long time but never made much noise in terms of performance. So it makes sense that it remains in service well into our time.\n\nThe Twingo was a predecessor to the Renault Zoe which was launched in 2008. The Zoe would be replaced by the Zoe Q5 in 2016 with the Zoe Q7 coming later in 2017.\n\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
