He has three siblings, two of which are actors. His mother is the great aunt of Michael J. Fox.\n\nAlain Delon said he is very proud of his son. \"He is someone who's very strong, but humble. I'm really happy with him,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter last year.\n\nHis father told The Advocate that he is \"very happy\" with his son, noting \"I think it would be wrong to try to pigeonhole him. But I can say that he's a strong person, I'm not going to lie.\""], "coupled_prompt_600": ["Alain Delon. Courtesy Of Anthony Delon (left)\n\nHow to Write An Essay About Alain Delon:\n\n1. First think of a few questions you would like to ask him in your essay about his writing career. In other words, make yourself think of something that you would like to write about in your essay. Then read through some books and blogs about him. Do not read any fiction about him. For instance, if it is fiction from the past, you will be reading stories from the first twenty years of his career. If it is fiction from the present, you will be reading stories from the last ten years.\n\n2. Next, list the following questions that you want to ask him in your essay. Do not say anything about the questions themselves, but instead write what they are about (or ask him questions for yourself). For example, in your essay you could ask him about the following topics:\n\nWhat he liked the most during his childhood years\n\nHow his mother used to play with him\n\nThe people he likes to talk with\n\nWho helped him develop the character that he has\n\n3. Before writing your essay, make sure you have gathered information about Alain Delon's childhood and adolescence. This information can be found by going through his biography at Wikipedia. There is also an online timeline about him at the Wikipedia Timeline for Alain Delon. Then, once you have collected this information, go back to your own childhood. Use all the information you have gathered so far to build up your essay.\n\n4. Once you have started writing an essay about him, do not forget to take notes on everything you have written. Be prepared to revise and rewrite parts of your essay based on what you learned during this process.\n\n5. You need to make sure you are careful when including different language that you use in your essay. For instance, do not include stories from the magazine (for instance, Playboy, GQ, etc.) as stories from childhood are not usually told by magazines. On the other hand, do not include any information in the introduction of the story about a past event. For instance, do not mention that in the past he worked at a restaurant, or that someone mentioned how he was born in France. Always add more details when you are writing the essay.\n\n6. Also make sure to use proper grammar and spelling. The following are a few examples of proper prose you should use when writing an essay about Alain Delon.\n\nI am always wondering about Alain Delon's style\n\nhis ability to be funny\n\nhis love of the sea, or\n\nhis taste for expensive watches\n\nHis love for the sea, or His taste for expensive watches\n\n7. Finally, don't forget to include the following important information:\n\n- who his parents were\n\n- where they lived\n\n- which town in France he lives in"]}
