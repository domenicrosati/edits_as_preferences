to be near, but it's actually rather nice. The atmosphere is quite lively and there are a lot of beautiful women walking around. Most of them are wearing very revealing clothes, which makes you feel like you're at an exotic strip club or a wild bazaar. There are also lots of people who are trying to look as sexy as possible, or worse still, wearing nothing at all. In any case, it's a very relaxed place to be, especially during the day when the weather is warm and pleasant. It's also a very popular destination for tourists in the afternoon, since it's surrounded by many small lakes. A bit more in the east is the old city, where there are more modern buildings.\n\nThe capital is probably not very well known even in the Mamou region, so the population is relatively small and doesn't consist of a lot of people. However, there's a lot of high class housing, so it's not really unusual to see families with more than one child living here.\n\nFaranah Region\n\nFaris' home region is an extremely well defended area, even without the help of the Mamou region. There were also plenty of soldiers present from the Mamou region, so people were wary. Even so, they still managed to take out all the invaders and didn't lose any military bases or facilities.\n\nThere was no major change in the way people lived when compared to the Mamou region. As a result, the people in the area have their own customs, lifestyle, and culture, which is very interesting. Although it's not considered a special region by the country, it's different and unique in several ways. The people live a simple life that doesn't involve too much consumption.\n\nThis region mainly consists of farms and woods, however there are a lot of large mineral mines and large factories. This means that the prices of products are somewhat expensive, which is what drove the rich to move there. As well as that, it's also considered a safe region due to the absence of any major threats.\n\nPeople who don't move here generally tend to stick with the customs and culture of the Mamou region. They'll say, \"They have that old Mamou region charm right?\" or \"That Mamou region atmosphere! I feel like a king living here!\"\n\nThere are also people who move into Mamou region and then move into Faranah Region from there, making them think that the two regions are connected. This creates an endless loop.\n\nAs a result of the people moving here from the Mamou region, the farmers in Mamou Region grew larger as the number of farms increased, which also decreased the amount of labor available. This resulted in an increase in food prices, resulting in some of the poorer residents selling their land to richer ones or just leaving the region entirely.
